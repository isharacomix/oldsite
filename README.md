Blog and Project Hub
--------------------
isharacomix.github.io is my blogging platform and project hub hosted on
Github Pages using Jekyll and Javascript. The places I'm most active online
are Twitter and Github, so this website directs people to those locations.
The top of the page features a "business card" that feeatures links to
important pages and featured social networks.

Below the business card are spotlights for specific families of projects
that I work on consistently, such as my blog.
