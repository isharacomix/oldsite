This video is my first attempt at a livestream recording. The livestream is
encoded in JSON using Typescript. It was generated by the [Shelr](http://shelr.tv)
application, and is replayed here using
[script-replay](http://mister-muffin.de/scriptreplay/).

Under the hood, it's just another blog entry, but it has the "replay" tag, which
keeps it seperate from the other blog entries.
