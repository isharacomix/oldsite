The first day of livestreaming the [Open Tactics](http://github.com/isharacomix/open-tactics)
project. In this livestream, I introduced the project and got used to my new
streaming environment.

I mostly worked on the design document to set the stage for what I'd be
programming. I think it's important to have a philosophy behind what you want
your game to be, since it not only helps keep you focused, it keeps you 
motivated in the sense that your philosophy should be what makes the game
special to you.

As far as programming, I worked on some basic drawing routines. I made a Grid
object to hold the maps that the game would take place on, and added a method
for drawing it. The next few days will probably focus on the interface before
I start working on the engine (units, moving, combat).
