Education
---------
I am currently enrolled in the [Computer Science Ph.D. program](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu) at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science ('11) as well as a Master of Science in Computer Science ('13). I expect to graduate with my Ph.D. in 2016. I did my Master's research under Dr. Peng Ning in the NC State *[Cyber Defense Lab](http://discovery.csc.ncsu.edu)*, where I studied cell phone security and network analytics. I am currently studying Computer Science Education under Drs. Tiffany Barnes and Edward Gehringer in the *[Games+Learning Lab](http://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu)*, which is itself a part of the newly established *Center for Educational Informatics*.

I have not attempted to formally complete any minors or co-majors, but have taken several classes in the [College of Education](http://ced.ncsu.edu/) at NC State. I have also participated in two courses offered through the Duke *[Ph.D. Lab in Digital Knowledge](http://sites.fhi.duke.edu/phdlab/)*, a multi-disciplinary cohort of students and faculty studying digital scholarship within the humanities and social sciences.

I have participated in numerous professional development programs at NC State, such as the *Certificate of Accomplishment in Teaching* and *Preparing the Professoriate*, two teaching-intensive fellowship programs that require students to attend workshops, implement their training in the classroom, and develop a professional teaching portfolio. I am also active in student government, serving on University standing committees, the president of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association, and as a vice president of the University Graduate Student Association.
