My name is Barry Peddycord III. Online, I go by the handle *IsharaComix*.


Education
---------
I am currently enrolled in the [Computer Science Ph.D. program](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu) at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science ('11) as well as a Master of Science in Computer Science ('13). I expect to graduate with my Ph.D. in 2016. I did my Master's research under Dr. Peng Ning in the NC State *[Cyber Defense Lab](http://discovery.csc.ncsu.edu)*, where I studied cell phone security and network analytics. I am currently studying Computer Science Education under Drs. Tiffany Barnes and Edward Gehringer in the *[Games+Learning Lab](http://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu)*, which is itself a part of the newly established *Center for Educational Informatics*.

I have not attempted to formally complete any minors or co-majors, but have taken several classes in the [College of Education](http://ced.ncsu.edu/) at NC State. I have also participated in two courses offered through the Duke *[Ph.D. Lab in Digital Knowledge](http://sites.fhi.duke.edu/phdlab/)*, a multi-disciplinary cohort of students and faculty studying digital scholarship within the humanities and social sciences.

I have participated in numerous professional development programs at NC State, such as the *Certificate of Accomplishment in Teaching* and *Preparing the Professoriate*, two teaching-intensive fellowship programs that require students to attend workshops, implement their training in the classroom, and develop a professional teaching portfolio. I am also active in student government, serving on University standing committees, the president of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association, and as a vice president of the University Graduate Student Association.


Research
--------
I am very interested in the relationship between people, computers, and code. In the most practical sense, I study how people learn programming languages by studying the artifacts they produce as they learn a language. My lab is working on two projects that achieve this goal.

My lab is highly involved in the development and testing of the *[AP Computer Science Principles](http://csprinciples.org)* curriculum. We have recently taught this course to a group of nearly 100 undergraduate **non**-majors, and have collected all of the *[SNAP](http://snap.berkeley.edu)* programs that they have written throughout the course. My lab is also involved in developing educational games that teach STEM subjects, including programming, so I also have access to a sizable collection of player logs in the game. In both of these cases, I am studying the "programs" that students have written in an effort to discover patterns of behavior that are related to learning or mastering the programming language or the rules of the game.

However, in the most broad sense, I am interested in how human beings learn and apply rules to control the behavior of systems. Systems can include anything from computers to games to economics, and I find the way that "languages" - structured protocols for interacting with these systems - are learned and mastered in an effort to control the systems. I am interested in how the properties and attributes of the system affect the design and capabilities of the language, and how the design of the language affects the learnability of the language. A term that I've heard and like (yet hesitate to use for myself at this point) is *Critical Code Studies*, which I see as being the study of code and languages using from a critical theory perspective. I find this introspective look at the usage, the design, and even the very *definitions* of "code" and the societies of people responsible to be very interesting and very important to study.
