title: Research is Hard

I saw a post on Slashdot about a website called
[Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Main_Page), and that launched
a depressing set of Tweets about the things that bother me about the world of
academia.

One thing that frustrates me in particular is the entrenched reverence we give
to peer-reviewed scholarship. In theory, the reason we respect it is that
well-established researchers in our field have vetted the work to ensure that
it is valid and meaningful. Since a few curators have examined the work and
ensured that it is of high quality, we should feel confident when a paper states
something that goes against our intuition, we should give way to the folks who
actually did the study to prove what was what.

But I've seen time and time again that reality doesn't work this way. Bad papers
are published, bad papers get cited, and bad papers become the baseline for
future bad research. Everyone and their brother has already written about how the
academic publishing model is broken beyond repair, so I'm not going to get into
that now. The way I respond to the broken system is by taking pride in doing
good science and encouraging others to do good science as well. The publishing
system just breaks my faith in the parts of the community that I can't vet
personally, so it requires us to be more vigilant in not believing everything
we read. This especially increases the workload for our professors, as they have
to be aware of the poorly done stuff as well in order to ensure their young
advisees don't get turned down the wrong road during the formative years of their
career.

The one thing I look forward to more than anything about becoming a professor
is having my own lab of Ph.D. students. Don't get me wrong, I love teaching in
the classroom, but there is something about working with a group of students for
3 to 5 years and cultivating them into doing research that you can be proud of.
As far as I'm concerned, the role of the tenured professor should not be about
doing great research - it should be about creating great researchers. I always
say that the true measure of a successful professor is based on the exploits of
the students they have advised, and I value the advisors who hold this belief
above all others. Adding to the field of science is as much about the research
itself as it is about ensuring that the next generation takes their work
seriously. This is my motivation for going the total-academic road through and
beyond my Ph.D.
