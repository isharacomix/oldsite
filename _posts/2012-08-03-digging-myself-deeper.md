As a geek, I'm inherently attracted to getting new and shiny computing devices to play with, but as a grad student, I'm inherently poor. As you can well see, there is a massive conflict between those two inherent traits. My everyday laptop is starting to fall to pieces as the battery is gone, the screen's backlight blinks out on occassion, and just this morning, Linux couldn't find the computer's hard drive. While a sane person would have chucked it and switched to a new machine while the getting was good, I would much rather prefer to run this computer within an inch of its life... and then some.

Recently I've been thinking that I should get a tower computer rather than a laptop, since towers generally last longer (and are cheaper) than laptops with the same specs. Unfortunately, I hate buying commodity machines from the store or online because they are always bogged down with garbage and they charge far more than I'm willing to pay. However, it was just my luck that NC State was having its surplus sale when they were selling off their towers for ridiculously low prices. As such, I got a 64-bit dual core AMD computer with a a 160GB Hard Drive for only $20, which is great...

right?

Granted, I had to supply all of the other peripherals, but being surrounded by geeky friends I had some channels to pick up some goodies. One who was willing to give me a keyboard and another let me pick up a CRT from him so he wouldn't have to pay to have the city trash it for him. All that was left was to get a new mouse and some RAM (since I've already decided I can't run with <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/04/19/four-times-the-power">only 512 MB</a>), so I shelled out $50 to bring it up to 4 GB and bought a cheap little mouse to give me some control over the machine. And that's when the fun starts.

When my RAM arrived yesterday and I plugged it in, I was so excited until I discovered that Fedora would not boot. I was running a 64-bit computer, so it had no excuse not to recognize the paltry 4GB of memory, yet once the OS loaded its kernel, it locks up. The RAM isn't bad, either! Memtest reports everything is ship-shape and as long as only one of the two sticks of RAM is installed, it works just fine. It only dies when both sticks are in, and I can't imagine for the life of me why that is (since people seem to be running machines with substantially more memory than mine). However, instead of wasting any more time trying to figure out why it was being so stubborn, I decided to instead reinstall the OS (AGAIN!) to a 32-bit version of Fedora. That way I could utilize at least 3.4GB of the RAM I bought. That brings it right up to the same specs as my 4-year-old laptop.

As long as this setup holds up, the plan is to lay off on using my laptop, and focus instead on using my desktop both when I'm at home and in my lab at school. This should avoid wearing out my equipment any more than I have to. Warts and all, the best part about making this investment is that I have enough equipment available so that my workflow won't be interrupted if one of these laptops fail me. That's the most important aspect of any backup plan. I would very much like to get through the rest of my Ph.D. without having to lay down multiple hundreds of dollars on new equipment.
