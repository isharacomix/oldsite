title: Four times the POWER!

I'm a pretty terrible geek - I've already mentioned this. I don't have a smart phone or a tablet. My current computer is a four-year old Dell Inspiron 1420 that I got as a starting college gift, and has lasted me my entire career, while my OLD computer (the one I used when <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/04/03/how-ready-are-you/">this one failed</a>) is nearly SEVEN years old. It was the first laptop I ever got, a Dell Inspiron 1300 and it's survived for half of high school and all of college. Say what you want about Dell, but these computers are built to last.

However, RAM seems to be a looming problem no matter what I do. While the RAM in seven-year-old is still fine, the problem is that there's just not enough of it. <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> flat-out refuses to install on a machine with less than 700M of RAM (even though wireless works totally out of the box on it!) and even lightweight installations like <a href="http://xubuntu.org">Xubuntu</a> run sluggishly. Let's just face it, 512 just isn't enough these days. Luckily, the motherboard supports more than that.

Like, four times more. That's 2G.

Goodness gracious - it's like a whole new machine now. It boots up without even trying to display the progress bar, I'm able to open my browser and e-mail client <em>at the same time</em>. It's such an amazing change, actually being able to get things done. I suppose it's too old to be leaving on for extended periods of time, but when things get rough, or when I need a holding ground for files while changing operating systems, it works pretty well for that. I'm planning on putting Ubuntu 12.04 <em>Precise</em> on both of my machines when school finishes up this semester.

Speaking of both machines, the 1420 is a newer model, so its motherboard supports about 3.4G of RAM. However, the RAM has actually been bad for years - there is just a little section of the original 2G chip that was in this machine that wouldn't read or write correctly, leading to bizarre failures in the most mundane operations. Since I wanted to get the 1300 up to speed, I decided to shell out and get some new RAM for both of them.

Considering that we bought the 1300 for about $1000, the seven years that I've had it means that it has become an investment of about 39 cents per day of operation, which is really good for a laptop. We got the 1420 for a bit cheaper, around $800, meaning it's cost about 55 cents per day. While I'm not going to go off and buy a new computer any time soon, I can say that their extended lives speak volumes about how well I take care of my computers. Since the investment has been this good so far, I figure that a paltry $60 for some new RAM is a great way to get at least another year or two out of these machines. In fact, if I can get these two machines to last me through my Ph.D., I'll be a happy man indeed.
