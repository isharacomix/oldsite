title: A New Toy!

In act of unparalleled hypocrisy, after writing an article about how I don't just go out and buy the latest and greatest thing, I have just bought the latest and greatest thing. I am now the proud father of a healthy baby girl <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7">Nexus 7</a> weighing at 2 pounds. It certainly got shipped over here in a jiffy - though I wouldn't have minded not having to pay $30 for two-day shipping. At any rate, here it is.

So first of all, yay. I finally got a new toy, and I'm excited as heck about it. As someone who is typing this blog entry on a surplus Dell tower computer using a CRT monitor, I'm very much steeped in the "devices are on when you're using them and off when you're not" philosophy. Having "always-on" devices like smartphones and tablets seems kind of wasteful from that perspective. On the other hand, you don't want to have to go through the trouble of pulling out a laptop, booting it up, and getting your workspace situated when all you want to do is quickly respond to an e-mail or write up a microblog post about a neat talk you just saw at the conference you're at. But the possibilities of ubquitous computing go beyond that.

One of the first apps I downloaded for my new device was the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.matthewwardrop.scholarley&amp;hl=en">Scholarley</a> beta app that uses <a href="http://mendeley.com">Mendeley's</a> Open Android API to allow you to look at your citation collection on the go. This is particularly nice if you want to read a paper while flying to a conference and don't want to fish out your laptop on the way. While Scholarley does not yet permit the annotation of documents on the Android device (meaning that even if I read it, I have to get on an old-fashioned computer to do my annotations), when that functionality is included, not only can you annotate papers, but you can even annotate presentation slide decks... and not just with text, but with photos and video! Wouldn't that be something?

That's the first immediately useful thing I can think of when it comes to my new toy, but another thing I've had in the back of my mind for a while is taking course management systems to mobile devices. We're moving to an age where instead of having to go to websites to participate in social networks, you download mobile apps and run them in the background, letting them bring things to your attention without you having to - who actually posts to Twitter from the Twitter website? Obviously another app I got immediately was the Twitter app (for reading) and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere&amp;hl=en">Twidere</a> app (for posting to identi.ca). As course management systems begin to take advantage of social networking aspects to improve student engagement, the barrier for participation will become lower and more natural as CMSes are seamlessly integrated into our smartphones and tablets.

I'm not happy with the shift from general purpose computers to commodity consumer computing devices, but as I have started working more and developing less, the full computer does seem - in fact - like overkill. While I would always use a full computer for the purposes of developing code or writing papers, when it comes to using the Internet for its <em>true</em> purposes, which is connecting people to each other, you don't need a full computer for that. That being said, I would prefer to have an open device like the Nexus 7 rather than a Kindle or Nook tablet, as those are much too locked down to be useful.

I'll keep reporting on how well this thing fits into my workflow, and maybe I'll even get back into game development so that I can try programming for this thing. Apps are the future, man!
