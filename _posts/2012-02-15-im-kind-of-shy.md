title: I'm kind of shy...
---

So for those of you who don't keep track of calendars, yesterday was Valentine's Day, and once again, I spent it eating lots of ice cream and watching anime. While the romantic hijinks were kept to an unfortunate minimum, other social events of blog-worthy interest still managed to occur, and shall be the topic of today's writing. Wooooo.

It all started off with me going to yet another Professional Development Seminar - this one was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</a>. I had already been to this seminar in the Fall, but it was marketed as a teaching workshop last time, so I figured I'd go and see what made this one different. During the workshop, the speaker said something that I took issue with: "shyness and introversion are not negative personality traits." I take issue with this because I believe that shyness and introversion are completely orthogonal to one another, and that shyness itself is a flaw. I see it as something to be conquered, introversion notwithstanding. So since I'm a graduate student in Computer Science, I'm obviously qualified to write a blog entry about my interpretation of the psychology behind this opinion.

Many people would consider me to be introverted. That I'm as quiet as I am because I prefer to keep to myself rather than spend time with others. Because I <i>like</i> spending time alone. It comes with being a computer-science-phd-student-nerd-guy, right?

I wholly believe that anyone with this interpretation of me is wrong.

I <i>hate</i> spending time by myself. When I'm alone, I'm restless and completely beside myself. I really enjoy talking and spending time with other people, even strangers! I always look forward to the free-form discussion at the bar after our Linux Users Group finishes the technical meeting, or the networking before our IEEE technical talks. The problem is that I'm just too nervous to start speaking to someone on my own. Instead, I have to wait until someone else talks to me first, and that gets a little frustrating.

For this reason, I consider myself to be a <b>shy extrovert</b>. In other words, my fear of meeting and interacting with strangers gets in the way of the social interaction that I crave. There are people out there who are capable of introducing themselves to others without any hesitation, and I constantly find myself baffled by these sorts of folks. I fail to comprehend the mind of someone who can do that, someone who can take the initiative when meeting new people.

Because I'm uncomfortable in new and unusual social situations, most of the so-called "personality tests" I've taken will look at my shyness, and attempt to convince me that I'm an introvert. It's very easy to conflate the two, but I think it's very important to keep them as separate as possible. There's nothing wrong with being introverted, but shyness - especially for someone like me - is a barrier that gets in the way of what I want in life. Not only does it mess up interactions on a personal level, it's also what I consider the chief issue behind my presentation anxiety. So these are all things that I have to improve on.

For what it's worth, I've gotten a lot better during my time in Grad School. Since I have a lot of common ground with the folks I meet at these workshops, conferences, and other events, I relate to them more easily, but it still takes a fair bit of effort on my part to walk up to someone and introduce myself. And I've been getting more active in IRC channels and the IEEE, so I don't have to go without human contact for very long at a time these days. Maybe if I work at it enough, I'll be able to finally get over it.
