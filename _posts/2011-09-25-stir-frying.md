Once again, it's another weekend where I put away the square cap and don the chef's hat and try my hands at the elusive art of fine cuisine. Last week, I gave fried chicken a shot, while this weekend, I gave another of my favorite dishes a go. While my philosophy is that you never need an excuse to prepare a meal with rice, stir fry still makes an excellent way to prepare a rice-focused dinner. So let's take a moment to talk about what I did, what I did wrong, and what I want to do next time.

Since stir fry, unlike fried chicken, isn't about cooking raw meat all the way to the bone, the goal is to sear the surface of whatever you're cooking so that it gets the flavor of whatever it's cooked in and hot enough to be enjoyable. This is especially the case when making vegetables, since you want them to be firm and crisp. If you let them sit in the oil too long, they get soggy, greasy, and generally unappetizing.

So from what I can tell, the trick here appears to be to use just a little bit of oil and to cook it really hot. Unfortunately, I messed up just a little bit, in that I used too much oil and didn't let them get hot enough. So instead of having my vegetables frying properly, they just sort of sat there and cooked... coming out just a little greasier than I wanted them to.

It all turned out pretty well, despite the mistakes, and it's always a pleasure to eat food that you prepared with your own hands. First of all, I forgot to add the water chestnuts that I bought just for the occasion, and that made me kind of angry. Also, it might have been better if I had actually bought a fresh bell pepper instead of that pack of pre-cut pepper mix. It wouldn't have been as colorful that way, but the pepper chunks would have had a more fresh taste to them.

Either way, this makes two good weeks of home-prepared foodstuffs. Next week, I think I'm going to try to make a lasagna dish. Making my own dinner every Saturday is starting to become a very fun challenge, and I'm just as excited about preparing the meal as I am about seeing how it tastes.

In other news, I haven't posted anything else this week because I've been so darn busy. I just can't find the time or energy to sit down and write something. I should really get on the ball and force myself to collect my thoughts into a pseudo-cohesive blog post more often so I can keep this thing running.
