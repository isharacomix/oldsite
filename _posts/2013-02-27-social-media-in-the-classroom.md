title: Social Media in the Classroom
---

Today we had the second meeting of the Current Issues in Teaching Research Reading Group, and had a lovely discussion - nominally about a paper1 on social media in the classroom, but quickly devolving into what the *affordances* and *consequences* of using social media in the classroom.

One reason why I love the idea of applying social media in the classroom is that it brings the learning to the students, rather than having to have the students come to the place of learning. If I had to put my beliefs into a single chunk, I'd say that I believe that the classroom structure and the lecturing model reinforce the negative image that learning is something that starts and stops with the beginning and end of the period. Social media puts learning into the ever-growing public sphere of the student, making them take it personally and present it in a way that gives them ownership over it. That's pretty cool.

There's a lot of pushback to this sort of thinking, both from students and teachers. But it's a fact of reality that a new paradigm in education is coming about, and me, being at the young age of 22, puts me closer to the younger generation than most of the people publishing papers about it. When we teach students, we aren't just delivering knowledge, but conveying attitudes about authority, teaching, and learning. I think it's pretty cool that technology can bring us closer to students so they see us as someone they can trust and communicate with - somewhere between a friend and an authority figure.

Lots of instructors feel as though having a co-learning environment where students are invited to teach one another and take the role of the mentoring undermines the authority of the instructor, but I see that as a fault of the instructors who build up this image of being an infallible source of truth in the first place.
