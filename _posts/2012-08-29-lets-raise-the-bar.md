title: Let's Raise the Bar
---

The semester has begun. Classes are in session. I'm teaching. I'm reading papers. I'm helping with clubs. The beginning of the semester is always full of planning meetings about every little thing, and I generally like these kinds of meetings, since they give me a chance to interact with my colleagues and find out what sort of world-changing research they're doing. I've even been to a couple of Preparing Future Leaders workshops this semester - and it's great to go to them with the perspective of a Teaching Assistant now! But somehow, even though it's only been a year, it's beginning to feel somewhat stale and routine. What was once new and exciting doesn't have that same ring to it anymore.

As Barbi would put it... <em>so what</em> if I went through the Preparing Future Leaders program? <em>Now what</em> am I going to do?

In a bizarre twist of fate, on Monday night I ended up going as a replacement for the Computer Science representative to the first monthly council meeting of the <a href="http://ugsa.ncsu.edu/">University Graduate Student Association</a>, which is the represntative body for the entire Graduate population to the political committees on campus and beyond. The UGSA is composed of a board of officers as well as a representative from each of the departments across NC State's eleven academic colleges. These representatives, in addition to representing their department to the association as a whole, also serve on numerous internal and external committees within the UGSA and the University, respectively.

This is to say that in addition to representing the Department of Computer Science, a representative would also serve on the Academic Policy committee, which oversees Graduate Education Week. Or perhaps they would serve on the Social committee, and plan parties to help Grad Students connect and get together. These internal committees are the groups of students in the UGSA that get things done for us.

The external committees are much more interesting to me, though. External committees are official University committees composed of faculty and administrative staff that directly affect the student population. This includes committees such as Courses and Curricula, the Library Committee... even a Copyright Committee! These committees open a number of seats to Graduate Students so that they can not only have a say in how the University they attend should be run, but they also get a chance to see the committees that they will be expected to serve on when they become faculty members themselves (teaching, research, and <strong>service</strong>).

While going back through my blog may contradict me, at this moment, I'm willing to say that <em>nothing</em> this summer has made me more motivated to get involved with my University than attending this UGSA council meeting. Everyone in that room exuded an aura of leadership that was both inspirational and humbling. These were people that I felt as though I could really understand and connect with. As Barbi and Melissa said, it felt like a big Preparing Future Leaders session, and I was right on board with that sentiment.

I'm now the Computer Science representative at the UGSA. Or rather, I will be... in order to have <em>actual</em> representation, we need to revive the Computer Science Graduate Student Association, which has been defunct for a number of years. Even though this is a big responsibility, something about it just seems... right.
