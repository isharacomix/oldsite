title: STARS Celebration and an NES Workshop
---

I'm quite excited this week! Not only is this the last week of summer before
I finally get to return to classes (which I have genuinely missed), but I'll
be attending the [STARS Celebration](http://starscelebration.org/stars-celebration-home/)
this weekend and will be giving a real live workshop on NES programming! I am
preparing for the chaos by convincing myself that this will be a good thing!

STARS is an organization I've been a part of since last year that basically
recruits Computer Science students to improve Computer Science education. By
giving students the opportunity to participate in service and outreach, it helps
hammer home ideas about how Computing affects society, but by getting students
to get out in the community and teach others, it creates an army of energetic
young role-models for even younger students to learn from and be inspired by.
This is a good thing, and I'm happy to be in this project, even if what I'm
working on has nothing to do with my research.

The Celebration is the event at the beginning of the school year where new and
old STARS students get together for a big party to get pumped to do good in the
community for the upcoming school year, and I'm excited because my workshop on
making NES games was accepted and will be held on Friday morning. I am excited
and also cowering in fear. If you don't know by now, I've been working on
a little project called [#8bitmooc](http://8bitmooc.org) since February of this
year and have now, finally, *finished all of the programming*. There is no
programming left. The programming is done. All of it. I am so pleased that I've
gotten my environment to this stage.

So now, the moment I've been putting off - content. I've done almost half of the
autograded assignments for the MOOC so far (2 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard) and I'll
be having the participants attempt the first two assignments during the session.
I've only got a few left to go, and then all I have to do is test the heck out of
my emulator to make sure that it doesn't end up not giving credit for working
solutions. On the other side, I need to work on my help pages, since that's going
to be where students get the bulk of their knowledge. While I've been using the
[NESDev Wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com), the coverage of the platform is spotty and
ill-suited as a stand alone resource. My hope is that I can rewrite the content
with better continuity, provide sample code and learning examples, and present
the content from the perspective of someone who wants to make programs for the
device - not necessarily understand everything about the device itself.

The NESDev community is ridiculously awesome, but game development is only one of
the interests that pop up in the community. I want to create a resource specifically
to serve that niche, and it's so close to reality, I can almost taste it.
