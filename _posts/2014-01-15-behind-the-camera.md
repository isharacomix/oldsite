Today I attended the first day of **#FutureEd**, a course I'm taking at Duke
with Cathy Davidson. You may recall that I actually took a course at Duke last
year, which was great fun, and I just couldn't help going back when I saw the
syllabus posted online. This course's full name is the *History and Future of
Higher Education*, and promises to be a wonderfully engaging and critical
meta-discussion about the academy. Not only is the course being taught at Duke,
it's also being taught online on [Coursera][], which is super-exciting. Cathy's
rationale is that she can't fairly criticize MOOCs until she's taught one
herself, a refreshing attitude that is a rarity in the world of academics who
just can't be bothered.

One phrase that stuck out to me during today's discussion was the idea that
in education - just like in many facets of life - we often don't consider who's
behind the camera. We take the technology for granted, and only recognize the
humans behind it when we're yelling at them when things break. We take our
courses for granted too, but a lot of prep-work goes into them (a fact missed
by our students and sometimes even our superiors).

I've noticed in my own teaching when you give students a look behind the camera,
they're more sympathetic towards the mistakes you make when you teach. I tell
my students that on some days, I genuinely have no idea what I'm doing, but we're
all smart enough people to get over whatever problems may come our way. From
discussing Bloom's taxonomy to talking about the course has changed over time,
letting them know why you make the decisions you do goes a long way. It also 
makes the times when you know exactly what you're doing come along that much more
authentically.

For anyone who's read the past three entries on my blog, I might sound like a
broken record saying this, but this is exactly why I started streaming game
development on my website. I set up a routine where every night, I stream a couple
of hours of uncut game development. Everything I do, from the successes to the
mistakes to the awkward silences are being recorded for all to see! Programs
aren't just made... they're written and rewritten and thrown out when you come
up with a better way of writing them. It's one of the reasons I love programming
so much, and yet, it also isn't put up front as often as it should be.
