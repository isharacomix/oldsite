The [Eastern North Carolina Section of the IEEE](http://sites.ieee.org/encs) had their annual family outing yesterday... this year, they went to the [Raleigh Museum of Natural Sciences](http://naturalsciences.org/) for food, fun, and friends. I was there as a volunteer, helping greet people, hand out food vouchers and name tags, and generally just being an expendable peon to help where help was needed. The event was mostly a "come see the museum and grab a free lunch" event, so my help wasn't greatly needed, though my availability was certainly appreciated by the folks there!

It was a lot of fun. At least, as soon as I stopped driving in Downtown Raleigh. All of the one way streets make it really hard to figure out where you're supposed to go, and the cramped spaces make it hard to think while the folks behind you are honking their horns and swerving around you. I'm just not cut out for city driving, I suppose. Either way, once I finally parked, I bumped into my first contact, a gentleman from the University's IEEE student chapter, which was very reassuring. We teamed up and wandered about until we found another early bird, so once we were together, the crowd of people naturally attracted the other Engineers to our little party.

It was pretty nice. The one thing I like about volunteering is that since the volunteers aren't set loose to wander the premises on their own, we're kept close together which allows us to chat and network. Since I still don't know anyone, being a volunteer puts me in a high-enough profile position where I'll get the opportunity to actually <i>meet</i> people, rather than going to these little outings all by my lonesome. I would not have had the fun I did if I was there as a guest. That's for absolute certain.

Lunch was pretty much nothing special. We had some sandwiches and chips and fruit. It was a really nice day outside, so that was fun. Nobody was actually aware that were weren't allowed to eat in the museum, so the only choices were to eat in the conference room or in the picnic area. I manned the name-tag claiming table for well into the afternoon, until the boss man told me that there was a point where it was just silly for me to sit there and hope that people would come.

After everyone left and everything quieted down, I toured around the museum for a little bit. We looked at the specimen room with all of the preserved critters, I took a look at the oceans and gemstones exhibits, but going to the museum isn't really an event that's worth anything going solo. Unless you're there with someone to talk and discuss with, then it's just not worth it to be there. There's little in a museum that you can't learn from the Internet. It's the *people* that make it worthwhile.
