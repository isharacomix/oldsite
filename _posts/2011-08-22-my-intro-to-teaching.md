title: My Intro to Teaching
---

NC State seems to spare no expense to ensure that its students, be they Grads or Undergrads, Engineers, Businessmen, Scholars, or whatever falls in between, are well-equipped when they take that degree and walk off into the cruel, uncaring world. One of the many resources at our disposal is the [Preparing Future Leaders](http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/preparing-future-leaders/index.php) program. PFL is an initiative dedicated to training Grad Students and Postdocs in three very important fields - Teaching, Research, and all-around Professionalism. Today, I had my *Introduction to Teaching* workshop.

We covered a lot of ground in just two short hours. Since it was an introduction, it was all about breadth and not so much about depth. We covered the basic points behind developing a good lesson plan: the questions to ask at the beginning, how to execute it in the classroom, and how to evaluate it after it's all over. We discussed strategies for launching discussion during class, and no-pressure ways to evaluate how well the class is learning the material (which is often related to how well the teacher is presenting it!).

Since it was spread so thing, I can't say that it was enough to turn me into a pro teacher, but it definitely put my understanding of the job into perspective, which is the first step. The lecturer (if that's an appropriate description) kept the workshop lively, engaged, and most importantly, productive, so while it was a fun experience, it still managed to keep me thinking about the important questions.

All in all, it was quite an experience! When it comes to academia, I'm confident that I can handle the research part of my career. I may still be a fledgling little Grad Student, so I can't actually say I've been doing **research**. Conceptually though, it's something that suits the shy, introverted academic that I know I am. With some polish and practice, one day I'll become a fine researcher advancing the state of science and doing all sorts of cool stuff that a very small subset of the population will be remotely interested in.

The teaching end of the spectrum is where I fall short. After all, I'm much more comfortable alone in my cubicle than at the front of the room talking in front of a whole bunch of students. And if I'm serious about becoming a professor one day, I know it can't be like this forever. That's why I've decided to take the initiative and start going to these workshops now so that I'll have at least some degree of confidence when I start teaching some time down the road. As I mentioned before, once I get to sit down with my advisor and talk about my long term plans, I'm sure I'll be able to work some teaching in there.

I give it five stars - I can't wait for the next workshop.
