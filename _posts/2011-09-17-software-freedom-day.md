Today is [Software Freedom Day](http://softwarefreedomday.org), the annual celebration of the start of the [GNU project](http://gnu.org). Software Freedom Day has a very significant meaning to me, since it was when I actually learned about the *Free Software Movement*, the ethical and philosophical mindset behind what has been popularized as "open source" software.

During my Freshman year of college, I was an avid user of the proprietary Game Maker program. It was fun, and easy to use, but it only runs on Windows (and I think a beta is available for Mac, but I'm not sure. I don't follow them anymore). So I was looking around the forums to see if there was any story about getting GM working on Linux, and I found a very outspoken Linux user who was advertising Software Freedom Day in a thread, encouraging developers to release the GM source code to their games. I was very intrigued by his words, and I followed them to see what Free Software was all about...

The GNU Project... the Free Software Directory... Linux... the GPL...

... Richard Stallman...

I spent that morning in the library reading *[Free Software, Free Society](http://shop.fsf.org/product/free-software-free-society-2/)*, which is a compilation of essays by Richard Stallman about the philosophy behind Free Software and the GNU project, along with other technology related issues such as DRM and the like. It was an inspiring read that really made me think about the role of software and how making it available to the public is a Very Good Thing.

After reading that, I was determined to get rid of Windows. So I started by installing [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) on my machine and getting used to the POSIX environment. It wasn't long before I felt constrained by the awkward combination of Windows and Cygwin, so I installed [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org) using [Wubi](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/windows-installer) and had the pleasure of a full linux desktop environment. By the end of that year, I totally clobbered my Windows installation and have been running a pure Ubuntu laptop.

This was back in 2008.

Since then, I've loosened up quite a bit in my Free Software obsession. I still have a problem with proprietary software and copyright law in general, but now I think I've reached the point where I can live with it without complaining all of the time. This is a good thing, I believe. Instead of spending my money on games and media produced by major outlets, I save it for independent developers, musicians, and artists - especially those who release their works freely.

ANYWAYS. As part of my celebration, I bought some new shoes. They're quite snazzy if I do say so myself.
