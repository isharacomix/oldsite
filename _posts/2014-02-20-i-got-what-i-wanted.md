It wasn't quite what I was expecting though.

Ever since Coursera happened what seems like forever ago, I've wanted the chance
to teach a MOOC. I was blinded by thoughts of data and openness and magic that
was all probably muddled by the euphoric newness of the whole experience. Now
that I'm getting to teach a MOOC myself, it's certainly something completely
different.

Being a part of the [#FutureEd][] project has been kind of a sobering experience,
though there are other factors involved. I've never been particularly fond of
forums, so having to manage the forums for a week in this MOOC has shown me how
ill-suited the current MOOC ecosystem fits me. I've always preferred blogs and
essays for expressing my understanding of the course content, whenever they
aren't projects that involve building something using the skills I've been
learning. I love automatically graded assignments because I love checkmarks and
checkboxes that I can systematically drive through. I love blogs because they
give me the opportunity to explore my own understanding of the course content in
a safe space.

I'm a bit bitter because my own MOOC project, [#8bitmooc][] has sort of fallen
to the wayside. It's been one year since I originally started the project, and
I really wanted it to work, but I realized that not only is website development,
research development, and curriculum development a huge burden in itself, 6502
programming is not a particularly friendly environment for new programmers, and
I was fooling myself when I thought I could make it accessible.

I was very happy that I was able to make a game using that ridiculous platform,
but it simply isn't realistic to believe that I could make an entry-level
curriculum around the topic, regardless of how much I love it.

I don't think #FutureEd is entirely to blame for this funk I'm in - teaching my
own class, something I've been wanting to do for a long time - is also taking
its toll on my research career and my involvement in other initiatives for
self-fulfillment. Teaching is a job you don't have the luxury of putting away,
since I have to fulfill the expectations of my students, my advisor, and the
university, and still produce research on top of that. I'm getting back in the
flow of writing papers, and I think I'm getting close to breaking through some
of the data that I think is the closest to what I care about.

I got what I wanted. I wanted a chance to teach while pursuing my Ph.D., and I
got it. After this semester, it's time to buckle down and brings things to a
close. I've been in grad school, blogging, researching, finding myself, for 
almost three years. I'm no longer president of the NCSU LUG, and will also be
letting go of my presidency in the Computer Science Graduate Student Association.
If anything is a defining moment of my graduate career, it has to be the
[chapter][] I co-wrote for the class I took at Duke last year. One of the most
important skills of being a leader, a developer, a teacher, whatever, is learning
when it's time to let go and get someone else ready to take over what you were
doing.
