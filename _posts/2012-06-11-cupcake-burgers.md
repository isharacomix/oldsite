title: Cupcake Burgers!

Yesterday was my buddy's birthday, so I decided I had to make him something that was a bit more creative than a regular cupcake, and I took some inspiration from a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cN0W52GhPY">Epic Meal Time</a> episode and made cupcakes shaped like hamburgers. I've really been neglecting my kitchen lately since I've been so pre-occupied with research, but my GradBlog just wouldn't be complete without an entry dedicated to culinary adventures, would it?

I didn't put as much energy into these cupcakes as they did on EMT, but that's mostly because I had to prepare them in <em>one hour</em> before I met my friend for his birthday dinner. I'm pretty pleased that I was able to make them work out. He was pretty surprised when I showed them to him, which was exactly what I was hoping for. Even though I didn't do anything fancy with the cupcakes, the presentation alone is what makes them stand out, and for the most part, that's what makes EMT so cool. Even though they do a lot of interesting culinary experimentation (I'd still like to try some Jack Daniel's maple syrup and French toast dumplings), most of what they do is about presentation - cupcake burgers, candy sushi, and even the waffle fortress (to keep the haters out).

Doing this reminded me how much I love cooking, even when it's very frustrating to get everything in order. I've been sleeping most of the days away lately since I didn't have a lot of sleep while working on these last two papers of mine. Now that conference deadlines are out of the way, I'm back in the "regular" research groove, meaning that things won't get hectic again until I take my Qualifying exam next month (and I'm not really worried about that one). Makes me want to make a nice southern fried chicken dinner or something this week.

So now the question is, what on earth am I going to do with all this leftover cake? I didn't have time to turn all of the batter into burgers, so I just put the rest of it in two cake pans and now I have one square cake, one round cake, and no idea how I'm going to eat it. I love ice cream with cake, so I wonder what cake tossed in the blender into a milkshake would taste like.
