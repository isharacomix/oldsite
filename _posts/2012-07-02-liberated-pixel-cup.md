Last month, the artistic round of the <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org">Liberated Pixel Cup</a> ended, and I must say I'm quite pleased with the results! The LPC is a two-month game development competition split into two phases. June was the art phase, where Free Software-minded artists developed game graphics to be used in phase two, the programming phase, where Free Software-minded programmers would try to build games in hopes of prizes and prestige.

The LPC is a really awesome initiative, supported by some big names including the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, and even <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>. It's awesome because it addresses an issue that most people don't recognize. Since Open Source originated from programming roots, most folks who are Open Source-friendly are generally more on the programming and technical side of the fence. While there are a few artistic types who sympathize and evangelize the Open culture, they pale in comparison to the number of programmers, meaning that for game development in particular, there is a substantial lack of... shall we just say, "good" graphics.

While some projects like <a href="http://wesnoth.org">Battle for Wesnoth</a> have some very skilled traditional and pixel artists on their side, the majority of games don't. Most projects, like <a href="http://naev.org">Naev</a> use the graphics of another FOSS game to launch off of, whie others, like <a href="http://cameliagirls.com">@CameliaGirls</a> decide to invest in paying artists for high-quality and consistent artworks. The LPC, just as much as it is a competition, is an outreach effort to educate people and tell them that Freedom matters, <em>and not just for software</em>! I've been consistently of the opinion that having copyleft licenses for cultural works is even more important than having them for functional works, a belief that's actually at odds with the opinions of some of the folks in the FOSS community.

The first run of donations to the LPC went to commissioning some professional sprites and tiles to serve as the "reference" for the art that was made this month, in order to keep all of the graphics consistent. Inconsistency is even more jarring than bad artwork, but because most folks who work on Free games are volunteers, there is no way to predict or enforce consistency in the work. So after this month, a pile of high-quality resources are now available to wannabe FOSS game developers. And that's pretty awesome. Hopefully this will prove to be an influential expansion of the commons and provide the community with even more resources to work with, all hosted by the great folks at <a href="http://opengameart.org">OpenGameArt.org</a>!

July will be all about the code - taking the resources made this month and doing something cool with them. I may end up participating, but I don't know. I really need to get more involved in game competitions like <a href="http://pyweek.org">Pyweek</a> (which I just missed in May) and <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a> (which is coming up in August). Even though I keep swearing off of game development, it's awfully attractive to a Free Software-lover, and the community involved is full of energy that I love being able to tap into. If anything, I can just hang out on IRC and provide commentary. That's fun too, right?
