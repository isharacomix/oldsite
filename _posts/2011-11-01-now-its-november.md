I can't believe I've already been a Grad Student for three months! In between the highs and lows of academic pride and utter hopelessness, I've managed to keep myself from dropping out and giving up for over half of a semester! Assuming that the Ph.D. takes me five years, that means I'm almost there!

So now I've been thinking, I've had this blog for as long as I've been doing my Ph.D., and I want to have some sorts of regular events to keep myself focused and writing. I used to think that writing about the fun of my research and labmates would be a cool topic, but considering how the work I do is kind of sensitive (I don't want to end up getting scooped) and I have this rule about respecting people's privacy (this isn't exactly an anonymous blog), I can't just blab on the Internet about all the cool stuff that we do in our labs (no matter how *badly* I want to).

So that means I need to do something else. I already kind of have a regular thing where I talk about the chaos I brew in my kitchen on the weekends, and that's proven to be a lot of fun. It makes me think outside the box, and it gives me a reason to play with that camera that I won. It was definitely a good way to use the blog, and I even made a whole category just for it!

If I was any good at game development, then I would probably enjoy making games and posting them, but since I'm not, I've considered doing some mindless programming, such as <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Circuits">redstone circuitry in Minecraft</a>. I really loved the idea of MUSHs and MUCKs where you had a built-in programming language and could build and program the entire world from within it, but because you could arbitrarily describe things and build the world with text, sometimes it just felt a little artificial. In Minecraft, it's nice that you can program totally useless toys from inside the world, using the physics of the world. I'd love to build a city or an amusement park and cover the world in awesome, but I just don't have the time!

The other idea would be to draw some little things every once in a while so that I can keep myself in practice and generally have little things that I can post. <a href="http://ihara.deviantart.com">My brother</a> is the artist in the family, so sometimes I feel a little overshadowed by him. He's recently started picking up some notoriety, so I'm proud of him! Meanwhile, my drawing style has gone stagnant, and even though I doodle in the margins of my notes, I don't have the patience to compose an actual picture. Might be fun to do a little "This is what I drew in class today" thing.

When it comes down to it, I guess I'm just a bland and wholly uncreative individual. At least I have science. Sweet, sweet science.
