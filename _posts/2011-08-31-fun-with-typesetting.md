title: Fun with typesetting!
---

I didn't post anything on Monday. I wish I could say that I was doing something so interesting that I forgot all about it, but unfortunately, it was just the opposite: going back to school is no longer exciting and I've fallen back into apathetic student mode. Ah well. It was fun while it lasted. But last night, I had the pleasure of doing my first homework assignment using \\(\LaTeX\\), and it was SO MUCH FUN. Yes, I know that sounds like a ridiculous thing for a person to say, but it's true.

This semester, I'm taking a course called *Applied Computational Logic*, which is essentially just a graduate-level course that goes over boolean algebra, conjunctive normal form, natural deduction, and the like. I personally love this sort of thing... every proof is a puzzle, and there's a thrill of discovery and accomplishment when you do the natural deduction at each step, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that YES, the solution is correct (proving the opposite isn't quite as much fun, I'm afraid).

I was typing out formulas and functions and then when I run the pdflatex compile command, out comes a beautiful typeset document! Well, you know, first I get compilation errors, but after a few iterations of fixing mismatched braces and dollar signs, *then* out comes a beautiful typeset document. There's something about a document written in \(\\LaTeX\) that just makes it look so much more professional than other documents. Resumes, papers, and math homework typeset in \(\\LaTeX\) are just some of the coolest things I can think of (which says a lot about me, I think).

When I took this course as an undergrad, I originally used OpenOffice.org's ability to insert math into documents to make my homework assignments look as beautiful as possible. While the end result of each assignment was nice, the effort it took to pull it off was often painful because the already bloated OOo was dealing with really large formulas, and it still ended up looking a little off (ever fought with margins and automatic indentation in word processors?). As I got older and wiser, I eventually learned about \(\\LaTeX\)... though, in my case, I started with [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/). It was a WYSIWYGish typesetting program that allowed me to do even more clever things, such as create tables and matrices. I used it for my Numerical Analysis class, so even though I had no idea what was going on, I still did a stellar job making my homework look nice.

Unfortunately, LyX is not as much of an academic standard as \(\LaTeX\), so I decided that it was high time to take of the training wheels and go full-time \(\LaTeX\). I've started learning about the language and how to make it do what I need it to do, and now I'm armed with an arsenal of various styles and templates that I can use to make any document look nice and shiny. I intend to use it for all of my homework from here on out so that when I have to write actual papers, I'll be familiar with my tools.
