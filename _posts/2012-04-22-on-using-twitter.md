I'll admit that during the Twitter craze, I mostly kept away from it. It was silly, it was inane, it was pointless... what use would I have for something as ridiculous as microblogging? Then, <a href="http://twitter.com/isharacomix">in a moment of weakness</a>, I go and create an account. Turns out it was a pretty good decision. I see Twitter becoming one of the de facto ways to connect with people professionally - it's not nearly as personal as a Facebook friend request, and it's not nearly as imposing as an e-mail. So the question is, with all this Twittering about, how does one use it effectively?

When I first created my account on <a href="http://identi.ca/isharacomix">identi.ca</a>, I hardly ever posted anything to it. Sometimes I'd go and update something, but for the most part, it just sat there, putting the IsharaComix handle in Google's search results for my name. But now that I've started getting more comfortable opening Gwibber, an Ubuntu desktop application for social media, and especially since I now have the miniblog in my sidebar, I have a tendency to use it a bit more often. Every once in a while, I'll repost a Slashdot article to my Identi.ca feed, which pushes it to Twitter, which pushes it to Fffaaaa... thing. Even though I can't even bring myself to say the name of that one social network, I actually post quite a bit to it.

So the first rule I've decided to follow for Twitter is to <strong>post often, without spamming people</strong>. Basically, I allow myself to post either a single quote or a single link to an interesting web page each day. Additionally, when I post a blog entry, that's automatically pushed to Twitter, so that means I post at most two things per day. This keeps me pushing readable content without being an attention hog, and that's how you build a healthy audience.

One of Twitter's other amazing features is the ability to communicate with celebrities as if they were right in the same room as you. I follow quite a few celebrities (mostly celebrity chefs. :P), and one of the interesting things about Twitter etiquette is that if you genuinely have something to say, you can feel free to throw that person an unsolicited mention (which means you put <em>@theirusername</em> in the message). Unlike e-mail, which is often cluttered and ignored by people, if someone just happens to see a post addressed to them and they can think of something short and sweet to respond with, you might actually get a message back from one of your heroes. It just depends on how many messages they're getting from others at the same time.

So my second rule is to <strong>not be afriad to @mention other users, since it's not nearly as imposing as an e-mail would be</strong>. The time commitment for a Twitter post is substantially smaller than that for an e-mail.

Finally, since Twitter is becoming such a big part of professional networking, it's important to let people know that they should feel comfortable following you on Twitter. Put your @handle on your business card and encourage them to look you up in the Twitterverse while they're adding you on LinkedIn. While Twitter is often used to post random musings or links to inflammatory political articles, it's also a very appropriate place to post "I'm giving a talk today in room whatever! Come and check it out!" This helps people see that you are active and gives them a chance to interact with you.

That makes my third and final rule is to <strong>encourage people to connect on Twitter just as with sites like LinkedIn</strong>. Don't just stop at a handshake and a business card!

On a final note, to all of the Twitter-haters out there, despising a communication medium because popular media likes to poke fun at its users kind of ridiculous. Twitter is whatever you make of it, and I've decided to try to leverage it rather than turning my back to it. It's just good business.
