I'm *everywhere*, yet *nowhere*. Just how many websites am I on, anyway?

 * Google+.
 * identi.ca.
 * deviantArt.
 * Wordpress.
 * Fffff...
 * ... my University server.
 * My Advisor's server.
 * LinkedIn.
 * Academia.edu.
 * Ffffffaaaaa...
 * ... Launchpad.
 * Sourceforge.
 * Github.
 * Fffaaaaaaaacc... bah. I just can't do it.

My advisor has recently told me that I need to create a professional page for myself, where I can post links to all my papers and that sort of thing. I'd like to think that despite the fact that this blog appears to be more about cooking and bourbon than anything else, that it's considerably more professional than the self-publication that most of the world participates in (read as, drunken pictures on Fffaaaaaaaaccc...).

But one thing that irks me is that when it comes to a Google search, looking for my name, "Barry Peddycord", doesn't bring up my blog. In fact, it brings up nearly all of my other social networking sites, which ALL link back to my blog. Despite that, it still only shows up on the fourth page. I tried doing some trickery to help my blog out a bit by using my full name as my Gravatar ID. At the end of this page, you'll see the words "About Barry Peddycord" instead of "About Barry", and whenever I write a comment, it'll show my full name as well. Hopefully the fact that this makes my name show up on more pages will give me some more visibility. I'd ideally like for searches for my name to lead people to this site, since this has essentially become the basket in which I put all of my eggs. I also considered changing my username on Identi.ca, but I decided that wouldn't do me much good.

I still use my old domain and server to do things like host files, since I don't want to clutter my limited Wordpress space with large distractions like software and video downloads. But this is where I do my writing and my self-advertising, since I like being considered a part of the Wordpress community. I don't really see a reason to get another domain name just for my blog (but I did anyway). Before I closed my old webcomic and migrated over here, I mentioned that it's good to maintain my presence across multiple sites, and have them all link back to one another. But the most important component - namely, the GradBlog, isn't showing up. And that's frustrating.

What's funny is that the GradBlog is the fourth result in Bing, which is very nice. While "IsharaComix" still gets me the hits I like (Bing and Google), I don't think I'll be signing my papers in the academic world with my screen name, no matter how classy I think it is. I would hope that people get to see the same results online whether they first meet me as Barry or as Ishara. Typically, whenever I have access to a server, like on SourceForge or IsharaComix.com, I tend to make it so that it redirects to my blog anyway, like <a href="http://isharacomix.users.sourceforge.net">isharacomix.users.sourceforge.net</a>.

On a related note, I've also consistently used the same avatar in everything that I've registered for thus far, except for sites that *require* a photo, like Academia.edu and LinkedIn. In the past, I felt like I had to revamp my website every year, but now, it looks as though things are settling down, and I've been able to maintain a sense of continuity in my digital life. Especially now that I've dropped the webcomic and have migrated to good, old-fashioned blogging, I've started drifting away from my IsharaComix.com e-mail address, preferring that folks use my University address instead, using it mainly for mailing list subscriptions and the like (to keep them from cluttering my work e-mails).

Faaaaaaceb... nope. I still can't say it.
