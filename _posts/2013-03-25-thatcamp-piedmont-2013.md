This past weekend, I partied hard at [THATCamp Piedmont 2013](http://piedmont2013.thatcamp.org/) over at UNC Charlotte. My first THATCamp was the [one held in RTP in 2012](http://rtp2012.thatcamp.org/), and being a veteran camper, I had an interesting perspective on the one I recently attended.

The demographics were very different for this THATCamp. The most well-represented profession at this one had to be our librarians, though we also had some instructional technology specialists in the ranks as well. There weren't as many Grad students at this one, but I didn't necessarily feel left out. I was still able to carve my niche, and I got a pretty good turnout at both of my sessions!

This time around, I had two sessions covering two extremes of my interests. In addition to giving a workshop on SNAP which I had planned to give from the outset, I also held an informal roundtable discussion on Gamification that turned out to be super-fun! There were only three sessions this time, as opposed to the five at RTP, but we also had less people - only about 35 folks made it to the Unconference. I had 8 people at both of my sessions, so I think I made out all right.

The "digital humanities" was not nearly as much of a "thing" at this THATCamp. While pretty much every session at RTP was DH-related, this camp was far more focused on tools with practical applications rather than research applications. I suppose I had conflated THATCamp with the Digital Humanities as a result of my first exposure to it, but it's not really fair to pigeonhole the conference or its attendees. Just because the emphasis on tools isn't my thing doesn't mean people don't find it useful.

It was nice heading back to the Piedmont for a conference. This was my first time in Charlotte, so I'm glad I finally got a chance to meet some folks from a University closer to my hometown. It was good fun, and now I'm looking forward to [Barcamp RDU](http://trilug.org/barcamp/) in May!
