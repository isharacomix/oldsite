title: Exercises in Technical Writing
---

One of the funny things about being a Ph.D. student is that you're supposed to be an independent adult capable of doing your own research, yet you still find yourself clinging to your advisor in hopes of validation and feedback on your work. Whether it's inexperience or insecurity, part of the Ph.D. "growing up" process is learning how to assess your own writing so that you can honestly say whether or not you buy what you've written. Unlike Undergrad, nobody is going to give you a grade and a cute little sticker that tells you that you're a star - you need to be able to evaluate your own writing and notice the flaws in it before anyone else does. So when I was writing my first paper, here are the exercises that my advisor gave me to identify some of the big flaws in my technical writing.

### Close the Gaps
Writing is a <em>linear</em> medium. Definitions and intuition must come before technical details, and every sentence must logically build on the last.

When a gap exists, the reader will attempt to fill the gap in their mind, but unlike you - the author - they are not familiar enough with the work to fill this gap correctly. You can't risk leaving anything in your paper to the reader's imagination. You have the power to direct their train of thought exactly where it needs to be to understand your work, so take advantage of it!

To find the gaps, read every pair of sentences in your paper and ask yourself: "does the first sentence lead into the second? Could I have lost the reader at this point? Should we break the paragraph here?"

Gaps don't only occur at the sentence level. Once you've combed through the fine details, look at the flow from paragraph to paragraph and section to section.

### Roll Back the Repetitions
There are both good and bad repetitions in writing. Good repetitions are those that remind the reader of recurring themes in the paper. At the beginning of every section, you want to start with a brief reminder of the problem you're solving and use that to set the stage before beginning to talk about the subject at hand. Above all, good repetitions are <em>intentional</em>.

Bad repetitions are those that slip into your writing unnoticed due to a lack of organization or planning before putting your ideas into prose. Scan through your work and find the spots where you repeat yourself. When you find such a case, first you need to identify if the repetition was intentional or not. If it was, question whether or not it's doing its job.

If it's an unintentional repetition, figure out which of the two occurences are in a better spot. The first occurrence might have been premature - perhaps you wanted to begin discussing a subject, but then got sidetracked by something else. Or maybe the second occurence is just redundant and can safely be pruned. Saying something more than once doesn't automatically make it important - at worst, it makes your writing messy and hard to read.

### Clear Up Imprecise and Ambiguous Statements
Technical writing is all about precision. Mark Twain tells us the difference between the right word and the almost right word is as profound as the difference between lightning and a lightning bug, and this is just as true in technical writing.

Words have very specific meanings, and in the case of technical terminology, these meanings may not be clear to the reader, so you have to define them. Once you've defined a term, it's important that you use the term <em>precisely</em>. For some folks, it's desirable to add flavor to writing by using synonyms for words that are used frequently, but in the case of technical terms (which will often be used frequently), it's important to restrain these urges so that the meaning of the message isn't lost.

On the other hand, there is also another tendency to overload technical terms with multiple meanings for the sake of brevity. When you're very familiar with your craft, you may understand what you're trying to say when you use a technical term inappropriately, but the reader doesn't. This introduces <em>ambiguity</em> into your writing, as the interpretation of the expression is no longer based on your writing, but on the reader's judgment.

For every technical term you use, check to see if you've defined it, and if you have, see if your usage of the term is consistent with the definition that you spelled out in your definition.

### Simplify the Intuition
Technical writing gets to be quite deep and confusing at times, and rightly so - if it was easy, we wouldn't be able to make a career out of it. However, just because your reader is qualified to understand your approach and data doesn't mean they're going to go out of their way to learn it. As the writer, you are responsible for teaching your work to your reader - they are not responsible for learning it.

So before you dive into the formulas and figures, it's expected that you'll provide the intuition for your work in plain English. The intuition should explain at a high and easy-to-understand level how your approach works, and (of course) how that ties back to the problem that motivates it. From your intuition, your reader should have at least a rough idea about how it works, but they should be clearly convinced that it works in a way that solves the research problem you introduced at the beginning of the paper.

Providing intuition isn't about "dumbing your work down". It's about <em>simplifying</em> it. Deep and meaningful technical work has a lot of quriks and limitations, but these don't need to be expressed until you get into the meat of your work. Give a plain English explanation, maybe even work out a simple example so that they have a model in mind that they can picture to help them follow the more detailed description that comes later on.

So now that that's finished... <em>MY QUALIFIER IS TOMORROW OH MY GOD I'M FREAKING OUT OVER HERE!!!!!</em>
