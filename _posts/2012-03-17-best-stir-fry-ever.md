I'm a little tipsy on cheap merlot and <a href="http://deliziedelizie.com/2012/03/15/sunny-sangria-time/">sunny sangria</a> tonight, so forgive me if the blog entry is a bit more disorganized than it usually is. Today was the College of Engineering's Open House, and I got to present my awesome poster! But I'm not going to talk about that today - I'll be saving it for tomorrow or something. Instead, I'm going to talk about the amazing dinner I made to celebrate the successful Open House today - the most amazing stir-fry I've concocted yet.

There are two major "dream dinners" I've been trying to perfect over the course of the last year - the perfect manicotti dinner, and the perfect stir-fry. While I've been doing a lot of the manicotti lately, since those ingredients can be bought and sit for a while, the perfect stir-fry requires nothing less than the freshest vegetables and meat to get the crisp flavor that makes stir-fry such a good meal. That means that you have to go to the store and cook it on the same day - something I don't like to do, but did anyway just for today!

So to prepare this meal, I did a quick marination of the chicken for about two hours in some spicy marinade... which is pretty much cayenne pepper and garlic dissolved in soy sauce. As an experiment, I also marinated one chicken breast in some merlot, just to see how it would taste (<strong>spoiler alert</strong>, I couldn't taste it). After oven-baking the chicken, I started the rice and made the vegetables.

The broccolis were simply cooked in boiling water for about 3 minutes and transfered to the plate while I quickly stir-fried the onions and peppers with the cooked chicken. Afterwards I served it all and sat down to a delicious meal! It didn't all go perfectly - I left the burner for the rice on simmer after it was done and ended up scorching the bottom layer of rice. That could have ended very badly if I hadn't caught it. I ended up making a pile of food, so it looks like I'll be having this tomorrow - it's nice to see that $7 pack of chicken stretch for a while.

I set the table and had the whole thing with some cheap merlot and ginger ale - I wish I had some real wine glasses to serve this, and not these glass mugs, but that'll have to wait until I can get up and go buy them. I need to get a full set of glassware - wine glasses, champagne glasses, brandy glasses, shot glasses... the whole ensemble. I can't afford to do without, because style counts.

After cleaning up my mess, I decided to treat myself to a real dessert. A simple milkshake wouldn't do after such an amazing meal. So I stuck a mug in the freezer while dinner cooked and then put together a prototype for the perfect sundae. The perfect sundae is served in a frosted mug, but I haven't really hammered out the specifics of what all should be served with it. Maybe slow-melted chocolate and some kind of crumbled cookies. I still need to think about it, but the frosted mug is mandatory.

All in all, this was a good way to spend a day. It's weird having a surplus of blogging topics at the ready. Normally I deal with a shortage of them, and that's just dreadful.
