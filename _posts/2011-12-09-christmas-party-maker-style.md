title: Christmas Party - Maker Style

I've been a little under the weather and a little depressed these past few days, but thanks to friends, food, and (most importantly) milkshakes, I'm feeling a bit better and up for another blog post this week.

Last night, I attended the <a href="http://trilug.org">Triangle Linux User's Group</a> Christmas party at <a href="http://splatspace.org">Splat Space</a>, which is a hackerspace located in Durham. What's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspace</a>, you ask? A hackerspace is basically a garage, a room, or any general area where geeks, nerds, hackers, and makers all come together to socialize, experiment, invent, and build stuff. There were tables and couches covered with electronics and assembly equipment, with old magazines and documenation filling up their bookshelves. Entirely member-run and member-owned, the hackerspace is a way for smart and creative people to pool their knowledge and resources into creating a spot where anyone with an idea and some spare time can start a project, and have fun socializing while they do it.

It was really something else.

For the Christmas party, we had a general purpose "if you're working on a project then bring it here and show it off" night, so we had about six or seven folks come by and do just that. Some folks were demoing linux distributions, others were showing off the cool stuff they pulled off with an <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, and others were talking about a start-up that they were building. <a href="http://redhat.com">Shadowman</a> even brought presents for us, since it's a little early for Santa (I got a Red Hat baseball cap. Woo!).

I really got interested in the Arduino project. During my last semester as an undergrad, I got to get closer to the metal of computing than ever before, by writing code directly for a microcontroller and doing things like managing output pins and whatnot all by myself. It was quite awesome. Seeing the Arduino and how easy that it makes that sort of prototyping was very inspiring, and has made me seriously decide whether or not I want to get a ham radio or an Arduino when I get my next reimbursement check from the University. An Arduino has a lot more features than a PIC, but in addition to being written in pure C (which I love), it also comes with a breadboard and all of the little gadgets that you need to make any number of cute little hardware-based toys. Granted, because the Arduino is like the swiss-army microcontroller (going for $15 for a PDIP-style chip), it's a little too big to put in something that you'd mass produce when a PIC is available for peanuts. But because you can program the thing using open source tools, and the Arduino itself is open source, I'd consider that an amazing value for the price that you pay.

So all in all, it was quite a party. I had fun. I had food. I may be giving a talk in coming months for the LUG as well, so we there's no telling what sort of fun things are going to happen in the future.
