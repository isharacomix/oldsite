title: Where do the days go...

I swear, it feels like the week is already over by the time I turn my head twice. There's something about a grad student's schedule that makes the days go by before I realize they've arrived. I know time is supposed to pass faster for you as you start to get older, but I'm only 21! I'm in the prime of my life! What's going on here!? Could it be because I'm actually "working" now?

Call me crazy, but I think it has something to do with keeping the same project on my mind for so many days at a time. I can't have a moment's thought without my focus slipping back to my research project... what problems I still have to cover... what ideas I have yet to consider. Things I've done, things I haven't done, what I'm going to report to the professor during our weekly progress reports. No matter where I go or what I do, my mind is on my project, and that's probably a good thing, since my project is paying for my rent and tuition.

During undergraduate studies, I had a full schedule worth of projects and subjects to keep my mind occupied in various different ways. A little bit of math, a little bit of history, a little bit of programming... I was exploring a wide number of fields each a little bit at a time. Now that I'm in grad school, I only take three classes, all of which are computer science, along with my major research project, and that's it. Very little variety, with a lot more pressure to boot. I can't help but feel a little crushed under it all.

The lines between the days have started to blur, and I can't really recognize when certain segments of time begin or end any more. I was very surprised when I realized I had to pay my rent this week, since it means that I had only been in school for about a month and a half. It certainly doesn't feel like that's the case. It's no wonder I've been slacking off on my blog... it feels like the week comes to an end before anything interesting or post-worthy happens.

This is why, in order to make up for the monotony of my scholarly life, I've started throwing a bit more variety into my social life. I've been going to all sorts of different events with friends and colleagues whenever the time allows, which puts some color in my weekly schedule. I never pass up an opportunity to chat with the labmates when we're all getting ready to head out for the day. Once it finally cools off, maybe I'll be able to stroll around campus, too.

It's not as though I don't enjoy research. It's far from that. After all, whenever I see myself getting closer to an answer, the excitement I feel can't be expressed in words (and it really hurts because I can't share my results with anyone before publishing them). I just want for things to slow down so that I can step back and take the time to enjoy the simpler things in life again. Just a little bit. I just complain because, as a grad student, that's kind of my prerogative.
