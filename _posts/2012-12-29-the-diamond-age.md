<a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/11/23/look-at-all-my-dead-trees">I have a lot of books</a>. Most of them are textbooks, reference books, or non-fiction narratives. It's not very often that I sit down to read a work of fiction, but after some very strong recommendations, I've finally started and finished Neal Stephenson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Diamond-Age-Neal-Stephenson/dp/1455884278"><em>The Diamond Age (or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer)</em></a>. It's a story that addresses themes of education, society, and technology by throwing the reader into a dismal, fantastical cyberpunk world. My review/analysis here is going to focus on the educational themes of the story, but if you're the kind of person who takes spoilers seriously, then you may just want to close this window and wait for the next blog entry.

Being a part of the subtitle, the Primer obviously plays a particularly important role in the story. The Primer is an interactive learning experience, a highly advanced computer realized the form of a book, that teaches its reader through fairy tales. The user assumes the role of a Princess who, along with her friends, goes on a quest to save a kingdom, learning things along the way. Reading, writing, counting, etiquette, self-defense, theoretical computer science, and even how to compile matter from their base atoms (referencing an in-universe technology similar to <em>Star Trek's</em> "Replicators", that produces artifacts according to a blueprint - complete with the Intellectual Property nonsense that consumes our modern culture).

The problem with the Primer is that it isn't <em>just</em> a computerized tutor. It requires a human "teacher" on the other end to help narrate the story in a manner not unlike that of a Dungeon Master in a role-playing game. When a Primer is created, an account is set up to pay this teacher on behalf of the student using the primer, whoever that may be. Suffice to say, the teacher doesn't necessarily have to be the same person each time. The presence of the intelligent human teacher makes it possible to respond to questions and tailor the fairy tale to the user. Is this a scalable form of teaching?

Doesn't that sound familiar?

The story makes subtle nods at education in all of its forms: schooling, training, reading, technology... even parenting. I'm no literary scholar, and I could never hope to be able to cover all of the themes that it addresses, but I definitely found the parallels in the writing to the topics I've decided to make a career out of researching. I'm sure that with a second read, I'd make connections I didn't make the first time through. Sometimes, we can make connections better through fiction... even fairy tales.

*The Diamond Age* is a clever and inspiring piece of literature and among one of the most enjoyable things I've read in a long time. The writing style gets a little tiresome at some points, jumping from one scene to another with each passing chapter, but it all just seems to add to the bigness of the world the author is trying to create. Unlike some science-fiction that I've read, I didn't feel as though the author was going out of his way to explain how the universe worked. Despite being in print, I got the impression that he followed the idea of "show, don't tell" very well.

I liked it. I liked the premise and the execution, and whether I got what the author was trying to say or not, I extracted my own meaning from what I read. It's a fun story, and I think that anyone who's interested in educational technology should give it a read as well.
