title: All work and no play...

I recently purchased a ticket for [Minecon 2013](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/MineCon),
an annual convention for the fun and open-ended game, Minecraft. At $150, this is much
cheaper than any academic conference I've registered for, even though it's going to be
a drastically different environment from what I'm used to. Why on earth would I do that?

Well, first of all, after as much work as I do in the Ph.D., I need to take *some*
time to unwind and relax. Minecraft has always been a game that has fascinated me,
as it appeals to my desire to produce and protect order in a world of generated,
random chaos. I think it says a lot about me that when I play Minecraft, what I
end up doing is building roads out into the chaos, lighting the way and making
my mark on the wilderness.

But then there's the metagame... what lessons can we learn, and what lessons can
we teach with a game like Minecraft? From the mechanisms built with redstone to
the mods that let us program LOGO-esque turtles to do our bidding, there is a
tremendous opportunity to use Minecraft to teach everywhere from the classroom
to summer camps. Even though I know this isn't going to be a convention focused
on educators, I dearly hope that I'll at least get to meet a few people who are
passionate about Minecraft and its potential in education.

I would love nothing more than to get to speak with the folks at
[MinecraftEDU](http://minecraftedu.com) to find out about what they are doing
and where they are going with their projects. It would be amazing to apply
data mining to Minecraft player profiles to find out how people explore and set
goals in a completely goal-free world.

What can we find out about human curiosity by analyzing the way people play
Minecraft? Wouldn't that be a fun question to explore?
