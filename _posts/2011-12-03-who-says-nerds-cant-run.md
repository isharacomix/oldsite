title: Who says nerds can't run?
---

I may be a sedentary, lazy, failure of a human being, but I still try to get out and work my legs. It's not healthy to sit in front of a computer all day, whether I'm an an Undergrad, a Ph.D. student, or whatever. As living things, we are made to move!

So today I ran my first 5K run for charity, a thing called the Reindeer Romp, which is a run for the charity <a href="http://www.gotrtriangle.org/">Girls on the Run</a>. I decided to run with a friend, and we trekked across 5 kilometers of track and trail, finishing together at about 27:10. Neither of us were racing competitively, but if she had been, she would have won the first prize for her age group. That's pretty cool, right?

I haven't really done much heavy running since my PE class last semester. We actually had to do a 5K in it, but since my grade depending on me getting a good time, I think I was actually able to beat 26 minutes or so. Granted, I couldn't breathe afterwards, but that didn't really matter, since I passed. Today's goal, on the other hand, was just to keep pace and stay at about a 9-minute mile.

I've been a lot more active recently, going to the gym and running around a few times a week with a friend of mine, usually first thing in the morning. Morning runs are very good for the brain, and I've noticed that after a run, I'm substantially more attentive, I retain more, and my grades generally improve. Unfortunately, I can't convince myself to go out and run on my own, so I need someone else to motivate me.

I've always been best at running than other kinds of physical activity. I have no upper-body strength, but I have a level of endurance that allows me to keep running effectively forever, especially when someone else is pacing me. It might just be because I'm as stubborn as a mule, because what I lack in talent and intelligence, I make up in perseverance. Ever since dropping soda from my diet, and drinking exclusively water, milk, and juice, I've noticed even further positive side effects in my mood, my performance in classwork, and other such things. So I'm very happy I've adopted a more active lifestyle.

In other news, I've been staying in classrooms more this week than I've ever wanted to, since we're working on a project, usually not knocking off until well past midnight. It's almost done, so hopefully I'll be able to put that away and focus on my first conference paper as well as my examinations next week. It might just be the thrill of the run that's causing this, but I feel really good about this semester.

Though I probably won't do any cooking until after exams end.
