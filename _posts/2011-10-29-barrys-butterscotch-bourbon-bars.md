title: Barry's Butterscotch Bourbon Bars
---

It started innocently enough. I was at the store, wanting to make some caramel cookies, but couldn't find any caramel to cook with. So I bumped into a bag of butterscotch chips and recalled how much I love it. I figured that it would be good enough for a quick dessert, so I bought the bag and went home. While I was putting my groceries away, I bumped into that old bottle of bourbon that I used to make the glaze for my salmon, and thought about how funny "butterscotch bourbon" sounded. It turns out that if I'm crazy enough to think of it, then someone has already published a recipe for it, and with the magic of Google, <a href="http://www.erinsfoodfiles.com/2011/01/butterscotch-bourbon-bars.html">I found a recipe</a> for Butterscotch Bourbon Bars.

I've never had anything as sweet as this in my life. The recipe is powered predominantly by a cup of brown sugar and a half cup of butterscotch chips, which is quite possibly more sugar than any human being should have in a year. To mix it up a bit, I added an additional half cup of crushed almonds, and decided to go against the recipe and only include one teaspoon of bourbon rather than two, since the one I added made the mix really thin, and I didn't want it to get any thinner.

Of course, I'm always amazed by how much things grow in size the oven. It felt like I was going to end up with little crisps, since it barely seemed to coat the pan. Then it grew to be nearly an inch thick after baking.

Other than my butterscotch bars, the only other thing I cooked was yet another plate of lasagna. I actually managed to pick up some manicotti today, but I wanted to finish off my lasagna before opening another pack of noodles. I'd like to make my manicotti on a bed of rotini... I bet that would be delicious along with a glass of grape juice and some garlic toast. I think manicotti would be an altogether better way of spicing up my dinner, since it's much easier to prepare it (and keep it together) than lasagna (which still falls apart every time I make it). I could potentially make a single manicotti tube every night and use that to add some cheesy pizazz to my usual pasta dinners.
