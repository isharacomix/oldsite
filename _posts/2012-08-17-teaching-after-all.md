Well, after a year of non-stop research, it looks like I finally get to teach this semester. I've been given the great honor of serving as the instructor for two lab sections of CSC 326, a junior-level software engineering class, and I couldn't be more excited about it! After going to nearly a dozen workshops on teaching fundamentals, I should know all the theory by now and be able to put it into practice... right? 

As it turns out, teaching is much harder in practice than it is in theory.

So here's a little background. CSC 326 is a course in NC State's Computer Science curriculum that covers the more "human" aspects of software development, such as dealing with customers, processing requirements, and making code that's flexible enough to fix when you deal with customers that change requirements. It follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning">Project-Based Learning</a> philosophy, where the high-level concepts are discussed in the lectures held on Monday and Wednesday, and applied in the lab sections on Thursday. Students are divided into four lab sections, broken into groups, and work collaboratively on a big software project affectionately known as <a href="http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php">iTrust</a>. I took this class back in Spring of 2010, and it hasn't gotten any easier in the meantime.

Software Engineering is a tricky class because you have to deal with the most realistic problem that can be created in a university environment: a team of junior developers each with their own personal machine and configuration, all working on a bloated Java-based web application. The first sessions, which me and another TA led yesterday, were geared around just getting the development environment up and running. With about 50 different ways to get all of the software deployed, there were lots of opportunities for things to go wrong.

My role usually involves beginning each lab with a short 30-minute lecture to reinforce the concepts that the students pick up in the regular lectures, and then facilitate hands-on activities where students get together to do various components of their long-term iTrust projects. So my job is partly about teaching but mostly about technology assistance. But I'd like to focus on the teaching, since that's what I'm interested in.

And let's just face it: <strong>I wasn't prepared</strong>. I thought I was ready to hit the ground running when the course began, but it was like everything I learned through FIT flew out of my head the second the lab session began. Most of the students were able to get development environment up and running, but I still feel like I could have done better. I can do better. And I will. I teach two lab sections each Thursday, meaning that before the semester ends, I will have led at least 20 labs (maybe more - I'm not sure when the holidays are). That's a lot of face time, and plenty of time for me to develop a style of interaction that I can call my own.

Reading books and going to workshops doesn't make you into a successful TA. You need to have the right mindset, a sense of self-confidence, and the ability to honestly assess your performance after each meeting. I know this material and I've been through the motions, so there's no question about my qualifications to lead this lab. For me, it all comes down to execution, and in that respect, each session serves as a learning experience and chance for me to grow as a teacher, mentor, and leader. Practice makes perfect - whether you're the Undergrad taking the course or the Grad Student teaching it.
