title: I don't want to miss out!
---

We held a [#moocmoocbar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94Oa22ij46M) this past
weekend and the interesting topic of which medium we use to communicate popped
up - something I've been thinking about for a long time. When it comes to an
online class, one of the most important considerations I usually have to make
is in what way I will accommodate the missing in-person ingredient that allows
two people to spontaneously have a conversation whenever they need to. What
platforms facilitate this differ from student to student. Some people are always
on Facebook, meaning that if someone posts something relevant to a group's page,
they will be able to have a real-time conversation on the topic. For me, I prefer
Twitter, since I can interact with it peripherally and engage it more directly
if I have the time and see something that catches my interest.

I fundamentally believe that a course is super-effective if it is conducted on
a platform that people use as a second-nature, whether that's Facebook, Twitter,
IRC, or Google+. Especially if different members of the course staff can use
different platforms to engage multiple users, the course feels more "natural"
and doesn't require the active engagement barrier required when it comes to
logging into a website, catching up on unread posts, etc, etc. If you're always
on Twitter, you just see your course information intermixed with all of your
other social posts.

We see this attitude all the way back to the concept of mailing lists: "it's too
much trouble for me to go and find this conversation, so I'd rather have the
conversation come to me and my inbox." I make this sentiment out to be a lot more
selfish than I actually see it (or than it acutally is), but it's a completely
fair attitude. With full-time school and jobs competing for our attention, there
are lots of interesting conversations going on that we'd like to be involved in,
and we'd hate to miss out.

That's a funny notion that we humans have... despite being already overwhelmed,
we still "don't want to miss out" on things, which is what compels some people
who aren't Twitterers to create accounts to join a hashtag chat for a MOOC and
then never log in again, complaining about what a waste of time making the
account was. While it's more than possible to archive such chats for future
reference ([Storify](http://storify.com/isharacomix) is amazing), people want
to be in on the action, and get upset when they "miss out".

I admit it, I used to experience this feeling myself. I was subscribed to dozens
of mailing lists that I cared about, like the Creative Commons discussion list,
SIGCSE members, POD, you name it, I was probably on it. Newsletters and discussions
and all sorts of nonsense. And then I was sifting through my inbox when it finally
hit me: in all this time, I have never read a single e-mail from any of these groups. 
Just like the periodicals that pile up in my closet from the ACM and IEEE, I
swear I'll read them later, at some point, but at that point, they are no longer
timely. And that's what makes the sentiment silly.

Drinking from a firehose is difficult. This is why instead of keeping up with
everything, I use my social network, Twitter in my case, to help curate content
that is timely *and* important. I don't need to keep up with everything myself -
if I need something, there's likely someone who can help me out, and I do my
part to provide links and references to the people I know who need them as well.

I'm already more in the know than many others, so if I miss one article on MOOCs
or computer science education, I don't let myself get bothered by it.
