title: Things are winding down...
---

I just finished up my major networking group project today, completing yet another goal before my first semester of Grad School comes to a close. It certainly felt good to package up and upload that final archive for the professor. Now that nearly all of the loose ends are tied up, I can focus on the two biggest priorities I have left - my final exams, and my first paper.

I never would have imagined that having only three classes would be so stressful. The classes are all more demanding, yet because I have less of them, they all have a higher impact on my final grade. If I end up doing poorly in one, then my entire grade for the semester suffers drastically. One of the worst parts about going to Grad School is that my GPA starts back over at zero, so I don't have 60 credits of A-level work to cushion my grade if a class turns out to be harder than I expected. And since I like to take classes about things I'm *interested* in, and not merely *good* at, this makes me want to weigh things like grade distributions and syllabi before signing up for them. That's really not what classes should be like, in my opinion. I want to take classes to learn, not to show how much I know about a subject before the professor starts talking.

Ah well. I suppose that's what audit courses are for.

I don't really think I need to worry too badly about my grade, though. I'm notoriously pessimistic, and I always tend to judge myself much more harshly than my professors do. However, just because I tend to get about a whole + or - higher than what I expect doesn't mean that I can slack off and try to skate by with the bare minimum. My obsessiveness and work ethic simply won't permit that. So I'll still do my best and take what I get with grace and humility. Because I'm cool like that.

So, I have three classes, which means I have three exams. On top of which, I have my research where I need to continue working on my paper. I've finally punched out the first draft, and *I* think I did a pretty good job on it. I'm just waiting for my advisor to hand it back to me with a big red 'X' on it telling me it's trash and that I need to rewrite the whole thing. Since this is my first paper, I'm sure I've done a few things wrong, so that's why I'm hoping I can treat this as my learning experience. A good Ph.D. student should be able to write a paper every semester. I think that's a perfectly reasonable goal to set for myself. And if I can write two papers a year, then I must be able to write three blog entries per week, right?
