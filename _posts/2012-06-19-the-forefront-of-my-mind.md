title: The Forefront of My Mind
tags: blog

One thing that irks me is that I often sit on an idea for a blog post for a while, only to realize that a week has gone by and writing something about it at that point is just going to make it obvious that I'm distracted and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. Just because it's true doesn't mean I want it to be obvious. For example, this past April, I got to go to a Celebration of Graduate Success at my University, yet I completely failed to write a post about it. Posting about it today would be kind of silly - unless I decide to embed my post into a regretful post about keeping things in the forefront of my mind.

I find <a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/06/18/how-to-get-a-job-in-academia-when-you-finish-your-phd/">lists like these</a> to be very helpful, yet frustrating at the same time. When I read a list telling me all the things I should be keeping in mind, I get frustrated because I start thinking about all of the opportunities I've missed, resolve to start taking the list to heart, and then promptly forget about the whole thing amidst all of the other millions of problems I have in my life. Setting yourself up for success is a rewarding, but extremely taxing job that requires constant vigilance.

As it turns out, we programmers take the word "constant" for granted.

This is one of the reasons why I keep a lab notebook and a paper agenda. One of the paradoxes of my computer is that the more effort I put into digitizing something, the less I see it afterwards (bringing into question the existence of my annotated bibliography). Even if I use some fancy note-taking software, I'll become conditioned to the alerts to the point where I can ignore them and focus on other things that are more immediately important. For some reason, when I have something on paper, I tend to see it a lot more, which helps me keep it in mind. So I like to dedicate the first page of my lab notebook as a sticky note page that contains all of the things I should be keeping in mind:

 * Always be on the lookout for things to write about (your blog, comments on blogs, guest blog posts, etc...)
 * Take some time to read the magazines the ACM/IEEE/ARRL sends you every month
 * Don't stay inside so much. Get out and meet people
 * When you meet people, follow up with them!
 * Go to bed at 11 and wake up at 7
 * <em><strong>READ MORE PAPERS</strong></em>
 * ... and so on...

I feel bad when I let a day go by when I don't do something that's conducive to my Ph.D. It doesn't have to be a big thing. A blog post. A comment on a forum. An e-mail to a professor. Just one little thing a day grows rather quickly into a web of connections and snippets of writing that I can point to and say, "Yeah. That was me." Writing a blog entry like this is my way of saying "I didn't do anything productive today so I'm trying to make myself feel better."

This may be a circular definition, but I find that the only way to keep something at the forefront of your mind is to keep it at the forefront of your mind. You have to turn it into a habit before it really becomes useful, and we all know how hard it is to get ourselves to start good habits. Once "being aware of opportunities that can further your career" becomes second nature, then you're in the running for living a successful life.
