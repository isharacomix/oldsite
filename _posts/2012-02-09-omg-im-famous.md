title: OMG I'M FAMOUS
---

So I went to another one of those super-fun <b>Preparing Future Leaders</b> workshops that I keep talking about, and I was greeted by our presenter telling me that I was famous.

Oh, merciful heavens... what could that mean?

So yeah, that's me. As we can all see from this, I'm a particularly poor speaker. I mumble, I talk way too fast, and apparently I have a bit of a lisp that can only be heard over a microphone. Also, just look at those silly faces I make! I'm quite the character, aren't I?

Of course, it looks like the only people who are actually checking out the video are the administrators of the Graduate School - and they all know me anyway, so it's hardly a big deal.

In all seriousness, I'm rather glad I've got this video to use for the blog, since I wanted to write about public speaking. As it turns out, I'm giving a presentation next week, and while I wasn't responsible for <i>preparing</i> this particular presentation, I <i>am</i> responsible for delivering it. A good academic knows his faults, and I know that where I fall short is public speaking, which is unacceptable for a future teacher. So my two choices are to run and hide from giving presentations, or stand up and face them.

I guess I'll go with the second one.

I get really nervous when it comes to getting up and talking to a crowd. Lots of people get nervous like that - it's nothing particularly special. When I'm standing up in front of a bunch of people I know and talking for a short period of time (like for the <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2011/10/04/lightning-talk">Lightning Talk</a> I gave for the University Linux User's Group), it's not so bad. But for a longer technical presentation, it's not quite so easy. Unlike small groups, its less of a dialogue and more of a performance. You have to have a script prepared, you have to stick to it for around thirty minutes to an hour (or more). Without the feedback and communication that goes on in a smaller group discussion, it's easy to get lost in the talk and start feeling self conscious about yourself.

And this is mostly a result of my mind being an unorganized mess. As you probably know from reading my blog, there isn't a lot of rhyme or reason to most of my entries. These things tend to take on a life of their own as I start typing. I don't begin or end a blog entry with any sort of objective in mind - I don't say "This entry is designed to inform the reader of my feelings on public speaking and my personal plan to deal with them". No, I just say "I'm going to start writing a blog entry and try to stay as focused on public speaking as I can. Also, video".

That just won't do - not for presentations, anyway, and most certainly not for lectures. I need to do a better job of beginning a presentation with my thoughts lined up so that I can effectively convey the information I need to in the 30 minutes that I have. It's not a discussion, and I can't think of it like that. I need to wrap my mind around my subject matter and figure out an effective way to present it.

I've given several presentations in my college career, but they've all been fairly lackluster, and when an experience turns out to be a negative one, it typically discourages the next attempt. I need to work harder so that my presentations become better, and then use that positive morale to power the next presentation I give. Now that I'm responsible for presenting work that I'm intimately familiar with, I don't have the luxury of taking refuge in the fact that "this isn't my problem". As I advance in my career, I will be the <i>only person qualified</i> to present what I know, and I need to recognize it as my responsibility to my audience to do a superb job when the time comes to share my work.

I've been thinking of investing in a nicer webcam and perhaps doing some video lectures on Youtube on random computering subjects to practice my ability to develop a lesson plan and to present it in front of a camera. Hopefully, if I make a regular habit out of it, I'll be more comfortable with it when it really counts.
