title: The Ph.D. Movie
---

Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending a screening of the long-awaited [Piled Higher and Deeper Movie](http://www.phdcomics.com/movie/aboutmovie.html), the big movie based on [the webcomic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php) that covers the drama, pain, and torment of the lives of Graduate Students, kind of like this blog. It was hosted by the University Graduate Student Association, and we had an amazing turnout for the film, which kind of surprised me! Judging from... well... the PHD Comics... I always considered Grad Students to be all lifeless and uninterested in stuff. I just thought I was the exception since I was young, foolish, and still haven't been completely hardened by the disappointing prospects of Academia. Go figure.

I actually almost missed it! I never received an e-mail about the screening, and there was nothing on the UGSA's website, so I was completely caught off-guard when they told me that I needed a ticket to attend. This was doubly discouraging considering that I invited a guest to come along, which reinforces my tendency to jump the gun on things. Of course, everything turned out for the best. Nobody got turned away, and the movie really was worth the wait. So how about a review? That's cool, right?

The movie is very faithful to the comic strips. It's not really inspired by the strips so much as it is a reenactment of most of the earlier strips, which was nice, since it managed to cover the Nameless Hero's first days on Campus. Oh, the joys of meeting your new labmates, getting to know your professor, and hunting for funding!

Since it was essentially a live performance of most of the comic strips, the movie had the feeling of a rapid-fire stand-up comedy routine, since it was gag after gag of jokes that you probably already knew if you had read the strips. Some of them were very skillfully executed, while some of them seemed a little forced. And that was to be expected. Granted, they still dropped a number of hilarious subtle meta-jokes in that you'd have to be very familiar with the material to understand, and when you watch a movie based on a favorite comic series, these are the sorts of things that you're really looking for, right?

All throughout, I saw scenes that were eerily similar to my Graduate Life. Group meetings, individual progress reports, stress. And from the laughter and applause from the audience throughout the screening, I can tell that I was not alone in that. The movie was made by Grad Students, For Grad Students, and I think we could all appreciate the fact that even if the movie wasn't the most professionally thing that was done in the world, they <i>knew their audience</i>. And that's important.

There are only a few criticisms about the movie that I had... mainly that Tajel didn't get quite the screen time I think she deserved... she was mostly put to the side so that Cecilia and our Nameless Hero could enjoy the limelight. And they had Cecilia playing such a major role, but they never exploited the [only girl in Engineering](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=55) joke, or her [Chocolate Addiction](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=104). And what about pi over two?

Despite my small complaints, I thought it was spectacular. And as a long-time PHD fan, I have to say: the ending gave me goosebumps. I can't wait until they make the DVD available in the PHD Store. This is something I definitely need to get for myself.
