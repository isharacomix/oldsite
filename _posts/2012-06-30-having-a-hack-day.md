Today we had a very successful Hack Day with the always-awesome <a href="http://lug.ncsu.edu">NC State Linux Users Group</a>. A Hack Day is basically a day where a bunch of computer folks get together with the intention of working on our personal projects but the expectation that we'll just be socializing for the whole day. Our expectations were met, and we had a really good time. It was great fun!

We had a really good turnout. We had 12 unique people show up (including me), three of whom were affiliated with <a href="http://trilug.org">TriLUG</a>, six of whom were regular NCSU LUG members, and three who were Computer Science students (and alumni) but new to the LUG and its silliness. For a hack day held over summer vacation, this was a really awesome event. We worked on code, discussed the future of the LUG, and talked about OMG NEXT REVOLUTIONARY STARTUP IDEA DO NOT STEAL LOL. It was awesome.

One of my favorite parts of the event was having the #ncsulug IRC channel being displayed on the overhead projector. Our President and Vice President are currently partying with Google in California, so they were able to chat with the group by logging into IRC and chatting on the big screen. The developer of our live feed actually spent a good deal of the hack day actually hacking on the code for the live feed so that we could see it well from across the room, creating a whole new style sheet and adding a clock so when could see when it was lunch time.

Another thing that we talked about (but didn't work on) was developing a new site for our club. The old website is hardly web 2.0, which isn't good if we want to attract new members. As the minister of propaganda for the group, my duty is to do things that will engage our membership. This obviously includes engaging social media, creating a blog, a Twitter, a Pinterest board, and of course, a retro BBS. All of this would be tied into IRC (our most important mode of communication). On a more serious note, it would be cool to set up a blog that discusses LUG events, and an RSS planet that aggregates all of the blogs of our members (meaning mine). Right now, the site is not at all the place you visit to learn about our group. You have to know us, and that is sub-optimal. Outreach is important to the success of a student group, especially when our leadership is about to graduate and run away to work in the real world.

I'm looking forward to beginning the next semester as the Secretary of the LUG. I'm hoping we can hold more of these hack days to give folks who can't attend our usual meetings a chance to hang out with the members of our group. While we may not offer people extra credit or free pizza at our meetings, our club meetings are a very rewarding social experience, and that's what really keeps it going year after year.
