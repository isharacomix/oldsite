*Comment and ye shall receive...*

... or something like that. Apparently when you leave comments on a blog, you're setting yourself up for getting people to send you stuff and write articles about you. At least that's what happened <a href="http://opensource.com/should-be/12/6/community-spotlight-barry-peddycord-iii-phd-student-computer-science">with me on OpenSource.com</a>. After about a month of interacting and leaving comments, and before I know it, I'm asked if I want to be featured in an article!

OpenSource.com is a blog about... well Open Source. I don't really like to call it a blog, I think it's more like an online magazine than anything else. It serves as the spiritual successor to <a href="http://magazine.redhat.com/">Red Hat Magazine</a>, and tries to take the concept of Open Source and apply it to broader, non-technical fields such as Education, Government, and Life. As I mentioned not so long ago, I'm a big fan of looking at non-technical fields from the perspective as someone steeped in technical knowledge, and OpenSource.com takes that and throws the principles behind FOSS into the mix... principles such as transparency, efficiency, flexibility, choice, freedom, accountability.

Is it any wonder why I love it so much? ^_^

I got to see a talk at one of our <a href="http://trilug.org/2012-05-10/opensource-com">TriLUG meetings</a> from their former editor, which was pretty awesome. What started off as an innocent <a href="https://identi.ca/notice/93571444">miniblog post</a> resulted in having OS.com follow me on Twitter. While I had followed the RSS feed from way back since the last Maker Faire, once they started following me on the Twitter, I created an account and decided I was going to start posting stuff on the site. I guess they put the pressure on me and got what they wanted.

I'd really like to write some articles for OS.com, but it's certainly difficult since Open Source principles don't exactly permeate my field of study. The bar is a lot lower when contributing to OS.com than trying to get published in a peer-reviewed journal, so maybe if I can bring the Open Source Way to some of my colleagues in the Graduate School or in my service with STARS, maybe I'll be able to write a short column on those experiences. The most important part is keeping my mind open, because I've successfully crossed an important plateau in my Ph.D. career where I am always eager and actively looking for things to write about, which I probably owe a great deal to my blog, as it has been the motivation behind my writing for the past year. As long as I'm keeping an eye out for potential writing topics, I'm sure I'll find something insightful and amazing to add to the discussion.

In conclusion: OpenSource.com is a pretty cool guy. They send me free t-shirts and doesn't afraid of anything. You should hang out with them on <em>#opensource.com</em> on Freenode IRC, or follow @opensourceway on <a href="http://identi.ca/opensourceway">identi.ca</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/opensourceway">Twitter</a>.
