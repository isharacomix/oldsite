I'm really behind on blog posts. I don't care if it's eighteen minutes to midnight. Let's talk about Twitter.

I love Twitter. Ever since PyCarolinas, I've been a Twitter junkie, and it has greatly improved my life. Except for when I'm at a conference, I tweet about 6 times per day, and fave/retweet between 10 and 20 tweets by other users depending on how much I happen to be looking at my feed. During the first day of #moocmooc (and the only day I actually participated), I was chatting just about all night long. While some people may see Twitter as a soapbox to post their ideas out to the world and feel important about themselves, I see it as a casual channel to speak with people who care about the same things that I do. A lot like IRC.

I realized that I was using Twitter like IRC when I was at the Reacting to the Past conference, but I suppose that only makes sense if you know how I use IRC. If I had to put what IRC means to me in just a short paragraph, it would go something like this:


> IRC is a way for me to chat with other people who happen to be in the same place at the same time as me. When I see a conversation happening that I'm interested in joining, I can jump in, and if I'm bored and nobody is talking, I can start talking about whatever's on my mind and hope someone takes the bait. I don't try to follow everything or even most of what happens. Just like in real life, if I'm not there for an event, I miss it, and it's over, and any decent friends in my personal network will let me know if I missed anything that I'd be interested in.


This addresses nearly all of the important aspects about my usage of IRC. Unlike a mailing list, which is supposedly something I would join if I never wanted to miss anything, with IRC, I can simply sit in, chat when it's convenient for me, and scroll back through the logs if there is something hidden there that I absolutely need. Always connected, peripherally listening, occasionally speaking up. There is absolutely no overhead in joining a new IRC channel, since I just add a new channel to my auto-join list and occasionally glance at the scrollback out of the corner of my eye. I can see whenever someone has posted anything, and if anyone specifically mentions me, I can direct my attention further. It's low-maintenance, casual, and not overwhelming.

Twitter is the same way, down the fact that "channels" are prefixed by hashtags. While many people say that "lists" are the best way to curate content, I find that to incur far too much overhead, and that following hashtags on a custom client like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gfeedline/">gfeedline</a> (on Linux) or <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> (on Android) is much, much easier. On my desktop especially, it's very handy to see the tweets pop-up on the corner of the screen, where I can reply to them quickly before getting right back to my work. Just like an AIM chat client you keep open while doing homework, my Twitter client allows me to drift back and forth between the periphery. While lots of folks prefer very engaged  and focused discussion for a limited period of time, I love the idea of basically having my entire personal learning network sitting, in a digital sense, just across the room where I can casually ask them "what's up?"

Oddly enough, one of the most basic features of Twitter is among the most useless, and that's following people. While I find it very encouraging to follow people who I like, since they will often livetweet conferences that I didn't even know were happening (before I know what the hashtag is!), in general if I follow someone, it's mostly a courtesy. Twitter is essentially a pseudo-real-time medium, in that it's more real-time the more people you follow, since older information is more likely going to be pushed down and out the bottom of the feed. At this moment, the oldest Tweet in my feed is only one hour and forty minutes old. The message I send when I follow someone is that if we happen to be online at the same time, I might be interested in talking with you.

Part of the best part about Twitter is that it kinda puts you on even footing with high profile individuals. While it would be really creepy for me to fire up my AIM client and say "Hi" to, say, an Indie Game developer, it's acceptable for me to @-mention them and not unusual at all to get a response - I even got a response from <a href="https://twitter.com/christinelove">@ChristineLove</a>!

You know, I really wish that more of the world used IRC, but since most of my new friends in Digital Humanities are on the Twitters, it doesn't hurt that I've gotten it folded into my workflow. While I do like that I'm able to chat faster in IRC, since not everything I say is going to be turned into an eternal micro-publication, intentionally slowing down what I have to say to make the most of the character limit raises the quality of my posting.
