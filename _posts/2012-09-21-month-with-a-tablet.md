title: Month with a tablet

I've had my tablet for about a month now, so I figured that it's about time for me to report on the things I like, the things I hate, and how my workflow has changed now that this bundle of joy has come into my life. I recently decided to get a Bluetooth keyboard for my Nexus, slowly turning it into a machine suited for content creation over content consumption. Unfortunately, the Wordpress app for Android still has some kinks to work out, so I'm not at the point where I write a blog post in it... yet.

It's weird how I'm psychologically comfortable with the idea of leaving my tablet on at all times where I feel as though laptops need to be turned on and shut down each time they're used. It's really nice being able to fish out my Nexus and flip through my e-mail, scan my twitter stream, or browse my RSS feeds, but I still hesitate to even compose a tweet when I have to do it on the on-screen keyboard. Any time I have to compose a piece of writing that contains more than two words, the error frequency when it comes to typing on a touchscreen is maddening enough to make me want to completely give up about four words in. As many words as I put into these blog entries, we all know that isn't any good for me.

The Bluetooth keyboard is small enough that I can carry it around, pull it out, work on it, and put it back without breaking a sweat. Furthermore, it's optional, so I only have to fiddle with the keyboard when I need it, which is only half of the time. The application level support for content creation isn't all that great - the only things I can really create are tweets and e-mails - but in most cases, I'm content with drafting whatever it is I have to say in a Google doc and then dressing it up whenever I get back to a full-featured workstation.

The goal of a tablet isn't to get rid of the full computer, but rather to tide me over between the times that I'm at my workstation so that I'm not doing all my work on my laptop. For the past seven years, I've generally used my laptop as my go-to computer, which puts unnecessary wear and tear on a mobile device. I've stopped using my laptop for a majority of purposes lately, doing most of my computing on my Nexus and on the <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/08/03/digging-myself-deeper">surplus desktop</a> I bought a while back. This is a much more responsible way to treat my equipment, even though it feels like my laptops are being underutilized now. I still need to carry my laptop with me because I don't have a campus workstation, but hopefully that will change soon as well.

A few of the disadvantages to using my tablet for e-mail communication is that especially when it comes to interacting with the students I teach (who make up about 75% of the e-mail I get these days) I don't want to send them e-mail using my <em>isharacomix.org</em> address, so I have to wait until I get on a regular computer before I can send it. I also don't trust my tablet with my crpytographic keys, meaning that I can't digitally sign my e-mails when I compose them on my tablet. Having a signature that reminds the reader "this was composed on my tablet, so pardon my terseness and lack of cryptographic signature" makes me feel a little better... but only a little. Most of the mailing lists I follow I signed up for using my institutional e-mail address, so I can't even interact with them on my tablet, meaning that the only communication I do with it is via Google Talk, Wordpress comments, and microblogging (which I'm perfectly OK with!).

I'm mostly disappointed at how hard it is to use IRC. I should be able to chat comfortably on the tablet, but the fact that I'm limited to one and only one active application at a time makes it hard to bounce back and forth between work and chat. Instant messaging is essentially a peripheral form of communication, done in the background between spurts of work, and mobile interfaces don't support this very well. I should also be able to write blog entries on my device, but using the web interface for Wordpress is a bit difficult on the small screen, and the app still needs some bugs ironed out.

All in all, the Nexus has been an enjoyable toy. I have yet to write any applications for it, but as a programmer, it's inevitable, isn't it?
