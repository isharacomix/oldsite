Do you ever get that feeling where you feel like you just have to go out and
do something creative? That feeling where you just have to go out and make
something? I get that all the time. Part of the reason I learned programming
was so that I could satisfy that urge whenever it cropped up, and while I've
never managed to finish many projects that I've started, it's always been less
about finishing than it's been about just scratching that itch. For me, I
genuinely don't care about finishing the projects I start, I just want to go
and program the same way some people decide to play a video game or go out and
play a game of basketball.

However, another thing that I get often is an urge not just to make something,
but to *teach* something. Whether it's a programming language, an environment,
or a board game, an overwhelming urge to give a lecture or develop a reading
comes over me out of nowhere, which is the same urge that drove things like my
[livestreaming][] and [8bitmooc][]. I wanted to make something, and I wanted to
teach something, so I decided to put the two together because I *wanted to*,
and because *I could*.

The challenge with treating the teaching spirit in the same way as the maker
spirit is that I often can't just drop teaching like I can a personal project
I'm working on out of my own interests. The projects I work on have usually been
either games or things like my livestreaming infrastructure... the digital
equivalent of having a workshop in your basement where you make your own
furniture just for the heck of it.

So wouldn't the teaching equivalent be something like inviting people over to
the workshop for a day of learning a new trick or two?

I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. At the Free and Open Source
software fair, I gave a presentation about [PennMUSH][], a server infrastructure
for hosting multiplayer interactive fiction. Folks really seemed to get into
the game, making things and digging new rooms and extending the world, and I'm
doing another workshop on it for [THATCamp][] at the end of the month. I suppose
I've also been looking for the equivalent of a digital workshop that I can play
around in, making things to satisfy my curiosity without the overhead of having
to do "engineering". MUSHes have been an enjoyable diversion for me for nearly
four years, and now that I have my own server where I can do whatever I like,
I have the option of making one that I can invite people to.

I don't blog enough, I need to blog more.
