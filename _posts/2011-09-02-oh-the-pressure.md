So between all the fun of LaTeX and classes, the research responsibilities have been piling on. I've been an official Research Assistant for about two weeks now, and already I've been charged with all sorts of software development and management. Roughly speaking, my duties at the moment include polishing a bunch of really slapped together scripts into a presentable and usable application, and then doing my own exploration to make it even better than it already is.

One of the double-edged swords of "research programming" is that while you're free to write your scripts however you want, you eventually have to make it so that your code can be used by someone who wants to repeat you're results. While "software engineers" make their scripts usable by design, folks in the labs hammer them out in whatever language is convenient (I happen to use Python, while my predecessor used Perl... the mix is quite interesting), with whatever interface gets the job done. The problem is that these scripts assume the comfort of the configuration of the lab machine, and if my experience is anything, no two people have their lab machines set up the same way.

I think it's because we tend to use scripting languages as little more than an extension of the command-line. A way to quasi-automate what we're doing. Creating a sophisticated file parser. Performing a very specific type of find-and-replace. Things that the command line would be good for, but much easier to plug into Python and run as a batch job with the added benefit of a very sophisticated programming environment. It's very comfortable for me when I need to get something complicated done quickly. I just open up a document.py and start pounding away! And then I have to make it so other people can use it too. *sigh*

Of course, it's more that just about programming. I did decide that the B.Sc. wasn't enough, after all. In addition to making these scripts accessible to our collaborators, I need to find some way to improve the performance (and ultimately, the contribution value) of this tool that we're developing. This involves more than just problem solving - it involves exploration and insight into the problem at hand.

Yesterday, when my supervisor told me that I needed to be **thinking outside of the box**, those words really shook me up. Being a Ph.D. student isn't about listening to a lecture and then parroting what they say on your homework or on an exam. It's about forging your own path to the answer, since the problems we're concerned with are the problems that haven't been solved yet. I already knew that, but hearing it from someone else made me reflect on my performance so far and how I need to shape up in the future.

On a lighter note, I'm not sure if it was this meeting that spurred this or not, but I believe that today, I may have actually developed some insight of my own. It'll be great if it can end up bearing some fruit down the road, but before I can pursue it, I have to take care of the immediate tasks at hand.
