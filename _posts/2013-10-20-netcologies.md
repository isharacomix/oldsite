This weekend, I attended yet another conference - this time the [Ecology of
Networks Symposium](http://sites.fhi.duke.edu/ecologyofnetworks/) held at
Duke University (affectionally dubbed "#netcologies" for the livetweeters).
The conference was an interesting affair that basically brought folks from
every discipline under the sun together to talk about how they interpret and
deal with networks in their field, from computer science to genetics to artwork.
It was engaging and somewhat provocative, starting off fairly concretely in the
morning and drifting into the curious and bizarre by the end of the night.

Originally, I was approached by [Amanda](http://twitter.com/stargould) to write
some about my work in networks, and considering that the topic I had in mind was
not specifically addressed during the symposium, I feel genuinely awful for
flaking out. Much of the talks emphasized the connectedness of networks - networks
as wholes of information that offer a very clear big picture that can't be seen
from the point of view of an individual node. It's a shame, then, that the
point of view of the individual node was not addressed. In a technical sense,
working in networks has a lot of uncertainty. We have protocols like ethernet
and WiFi that allow our networked devices to communicate, but they have to trust
other devices not to violate the protocol in their own self-interest. Nodes
have to trust one another in order to work together, and in many cases there
isn't much holding back bad behavior.

The first rule of making a website is to treat every visitor as an enemy and
make sure they can't break your website. In peer-to-peer networks, such as in
social media or multiplayer computer games, this doesn't necessarily work, so
you have to make some concessions in order to be a part of the whole - is this
other actor playing by the rules? What is the risk for communicating with it?
This is touched on slightly by the very first talk of the session, when talking
about policy-based networks, but what about emergent networks without hierarchies
where a policy can not be encoded and enforced across the entire ecosystem?

Networks are inherently unreliable, so the most we can assume is that the network
will make its "best effort" to deliver and receive information. When it comes to
programming a node, this uncertainty drives nearly every decision - how often do
we check for data? When do we assume we have been disconnected? How do we ensure
we are actually talking to who we say we are, and not talking through a malicious
eavesdropping intermediary? The talk that got the closest to this idea was the 
one around the Alternate Reality Game, [Speculat1on](http://speculat1on.net/),
where the people participating in the game are no longer sure what is part of
the network and what isn't.

This isn't to say that I was unhappy about the talk of positive and productive
networks. My favorite talk of the entire show was by
[Patrick LeMieux](https://twitter.com/alt254_) on the networks of people behind
who play games. Despite games being ostensibly a participatory medium, they are
treated by their publishers as very one-directional things to be consumed. They
can be engaged, but only in the appropriate channels, with modded consoles being
banned from the Internet and modders [even being sued](http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/10/18/blizzard-wins-the-case-to-shut-down-world-of-warcraft-bots/).

In spite of this, people find ways to turn games into platforms upon which to
develop new games, from speedruns of the original Mario Brothers game to the
creation of chimeras that use the output of one game as the input of another.
What was once simply a game to be played by oneself has become an ingredient in
artwork that transcends the rules of games. While I believe in games as systems
of rules that define a space (basis behind my research), these are the sorts of
emergent "play" that transcends the games' rules entirely. People are so
fascinating.

This was a fun diversion! I met some interesting scholars and look forward to
seeing how the digital publication of this work manifests itself. One them that
was certainly dominant was the idea of networks as nonlinear modes of interacting
and producing information, and it's only appropriate that the final work will be
published as a networked document on [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu). A big
takeaway from this symposium is that the network of interactions of content are
worth as much if not more than the content itself, something that hits home for
me as it serves as the foundation of educational data mining.
