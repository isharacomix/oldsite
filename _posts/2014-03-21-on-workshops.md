title: On Workshops

While writing up my last blog post, I briefly mentioned the idea of a *virtual
workshop*, and that's been in the back of my mind for a while. Yesterday, while
doing some research on my programming data, I ran into a graph theory problem
that was admittedly way over my head. A labmate and I puzzled through it and
I managed to make a little bit of headway, but despite it being an overwhelming
experience, *I had so much fun* bringing together everything I knew about the
theory and practice of computer science to solve this stimilating and terrifying
challenge.

Whenever people ask me "why do you make games on the NES", "why do you program
in MUSH", "why don't you just make something useful in Python", they often refer
to the fact that the *challenges I decide to impose on myself* get in the way
of the programming. For me, it's not about the challenges at all - it's about
*going somewhere specifically to program*. This is kind of a weird idea, and I'm
not sure how I want to articulate it, but bear with me while I try to piece it
together.

There is some special feeling when you make something cool in a weird environment
such as Minecraft or a Raspberry Pi. As a programmer, making something in the
"real world" like an Arduino or PIC Microcontroller is an exotic experience. I'm
pretty sure the novelty aspect is a huge part of what makes this fun, but there's
something more fundamental underneath: *the feeling of going to another **place**
to make things*. Programming at home is **work**. Programming in Minecraft, on
a Raspberry Pi, in a makerspace... that's **fun**.

Part of the point of a makerspace, workshop, or secret laboratory is to provide
a platform that makes it easier to do things. It's much easier to make furniture
if you have woodworking tools, obviously, and makerspaces provide those resources
which enable the work. However, going to a makerspace to make something is not
necessarily *easier*, since you still have to take the time to travel, meaning
we don't just do it for access to the equipment. For some people, it's about
access to a community - other likeminded people who are more fun to work with
than working alone. But what I'm getting at in this blog post is that *taking
the time to go to a different environment to do 'work' for 'pleasure' works
because it is a space with that goal intentionally in mind*.

For me, the *psychology* of a platform for doing leisure programming is at least
as important as the technical scaffolding. Whenever I want to do programming for
fun, I want the environment to make it feel as little like "work" as possible,
which is why programming for a Raspberry Pi is more "enjoyable" than programming
on the desktop I use to answer e-mails and do my work. The act of physically or
mentally going to another location/context to take part in leisure is a key part
to being able to enjoy what I'm doing. Even when I was developing a game back
in January, the fun wasn't in making the game - it was making the game with the
intention of making it available to spectators. It's what differentiates writing
a diary from fr

So that's what I mean. I want a virtual workshop - not a physical space I have
to go to in order to do leisurely programming, but a mental context I can switch
to and leave behind my work. I want an environment where I can do the fun part
of building without the less fun part of project management. As a teacher, I
want my virtual space to be a place I can invite people to, a living exhibit
where people can see my old work and a stage where people can see me make
something new.

It's more than the technology. It's the technology, its affordances, and the
state of mind that it encourages. If the technology isn't there, I have to build
the workshop before I can start working in it. If the mindset isn't there, is
there anything that can be built at all?
