title: On to the next level!

So the semester is over! Good job, everyone! Thanks for playing!

The final grade report card is a stunning 3.4 average, with an **A** in Logic, an **A-** in Internet Protocols, and a **B-** in Algorithms. I am very pleased with this turnout, as it allows me to bring my first semester of Grad School to a close with a healthy 3.4 GPA.

Whenever I take my first steps into a new set of expectations, I usually end up getting knocked backwards a bit. After all, in my first semester of college, I ended up getting a 65 on my first Calculus exam, because the expectations were so much different from when I was in high school. It was a completely different world, and because I took so many AP classes back then, I didn't get to step my foot in and test the waters - I dove in head first and just about drowned myself. I'd like to think that the transition from Undergrad to Grad was slightly smoother, but there was still a little shock to it.

After all, not only did I have three substantially more involved courses, I also had research responsibilities from the beginning. I was working on trying to improve some software, dealing with the human element of research during my conversations with the faculty and staff, giving my first technical presentations, and now, writing my first paper. A lot has happened in this one semester, and the pressure has been on me like never before. In spite of that, I feel more motivated than I do discouraged, and that's a very good thing.

Going into next semester, I'm taking another full course load - I'll be tackling a course in Data Mining to build up my analytics background, I'll be taking a course in Database Systems, and (just for fun) I'm taking a course in Compiler Construction. So that gives me two systems-courses and one theoretical course. This will most likely finish up my core course requirement for the program, allowing me to focus on research and electives for the rest of my career.

I'm very pleased that despite all of this work, I've made it a point to have some kind of a social life. I've been going out and running at the gym, and having dinner with friends every week or so, keeping in touch with the folks that I graduated with - who left the University behind to pursue "real" jobs and make "real" money.

In celebration of this, I decided to buy myself a Christmas present that I've been wanting for a long time - I got myself a scanner, so that I can doodle and upload sketches on demand without having to take a detour to the library. Hopefully I'll have more pictures to upload to go along with my blarg entries now, even if they are just random doodles that exist to add some spice to the walls of text I post.
