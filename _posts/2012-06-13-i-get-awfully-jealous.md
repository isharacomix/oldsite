title: I get awfully jealous...

There's a bit of a saying among my colleagues about grades in graduate classes: "Getting a B is like failing, an A- is passing, and an A+ means you aren't doing enough research." In undergrad, we put tremendous emphasis on being the best among one's peers, giving latin honors to those of us who manage to get GPAs in the 3.5 and 3.75 ranges. Giving titles like "valedictorian" to anyone who manages to actually get a perfect 4.0, while admitting them into selective greek societies where the only real benefit is getting to say that you're a member and other people aren't. What it all amounts to is a bunch of resume padding that, to be perfectly honest, I don't believe any hiring manager looks at and takes seriously (yet I'm totally guilty of <a href="http://isharacomix.org/cv">resume padding</a> ^_^).

So why do I get so jealous of people who have more of these numbers, honors, and qualifiers than me?

I recently watched the controversial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lfxYhtf8o4"><em>You're Not Special</em></a> commencement speech from Wellesley High School, and I have to say, it made me uncomfortable because it made me take a look at just how ridiculous some of my jealousies are. In the speech, McCullough addresses this fixation that many people (students included) have on "credentials". Grades, Dean's list, Latin honors, honor societies, professional memberships, undergraduate research, publications, years of teaching experience... if people weren't so obsessed with these credentials, they wouldn't make such an effort to highlight them on their resumes. While I may not have been valedictorian, I'm still quite proud of the fact that I was able to get my B.Sc. in three years, so I make it clear in two places on my CV.

When I get certificates of recognition from initiatives like the <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2011/12/14/another-certificate">Season Pass</a> or the <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/03/21/graduate-research-symposium">Graduate Research Symposium</a>, of course I take those recognitions in stride. But not once did I ever think, "gee, I need another line to add to the CV under 'leadership experience' - let's do this thing".

I never would have participated in these projects if I only cared about the credential. I participated in the Preparing Future Leaders seminars, the Research Symposium, the IEEE, the LUG, the ARRL, the ACM, all because they meant something <em>to me</em>. I excelled in school, made it on the Dean's List and graduated <em>Magna cum Laude</em> because doing well in school means something <em>to me</em>. I won't lie, I love having the liberty of slapping another university recognition on my CV, but the experience of participating has been more rewarding and educational than the credential will ever be.

So for the same reason, I'm not going to go and write papers just so that I can have a bunch of publications to my name. Even though publications are the credential that the hiring committees <em>do</em> care about, I want my papers to accurately represent the research problems that I care about and have worked to solve - not simply a metric of how productive a researcher I am. The credentials will come with my work, so there's no point in just working for the credentials.

So to end with a quote from McCullough's speech: <em>"Climb the mountain so that you can see the world, not so the world can see you."</em>
