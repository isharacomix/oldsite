One of my favorite features of Wordpress is getting to see what kinds of search terms lead people to my blog. I've been flattered, amused, and in some cases horrified by the terms people have used to find my little corner of the Internet. So since I haven't got anything better to write about, I'll provide my breakdown on a few of the search terms have led people to my blog, and my interpretation of them.

*barry peddycord (ishara comix):* I would like to think that when people search for my name, they would be taken to my blog. While a number of people find my Twitter or LinkedIn page first, and then follow the link to my blog, some people end up here directly. Google's searches are a bit non-deterministic on whether my blog will appear as the first link or whether a social networking site will appear first. Today, for example, my blog shows up first, but that isn't always consistent.

*the phd movie:* A really awesome movie based on the <a href="http://phdcomics.com">PHD Webcomic</a>, I wrote <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2011/10/18/the-phd-movie">a review</a> of the movie when I saw the screening at my university.

*the phd movie rapid:* Come on, guys. It's not that expensive to just go and buy it.

*minecraft banner:* One of my favorite banners is my minecraft banner. Minecraft is a very popular game, so it makes sense that people would bump into my site if they're looking for one. It actually appears on the second page of the search results, which is pretty spiffy.

*eclipse worst ide ever:* This is simply a true statement.

*dcpu-16 programming:* By writing a blog entry about a game being produced by game-dev demigod <a href="http://twitter.com/notch">Notch</a>, I kind of figured I'd be able to take advantage of the search engine tidal wave and get a blog visit by being among the first to talk about the DCPU programming environment for the upcoming game <a href="http://0x10c.com">0x10<sup>c</sup></a>.

*latex comix:* "Comix" is a word with a bit of a checkered past, typically referring to underground and less wholesome comic strips that were produced to cater to the darker side of humanity. And as an academic, I find myself coding in LaTeX more than any other language. So I guess it makes sense, even though I'm pretty sure they're looking for something very, very different.

*eating out my professor:* ... sometimes I worry about the world.

What kind of funny (or surprising) searches have led people to your blog?
