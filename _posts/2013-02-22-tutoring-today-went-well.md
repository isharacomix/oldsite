title: Tutoring today went well!
---

I'm a member of a service learning group at NC State called [STARS](http://stars.csc.ncsu.edu/), and in that group, I do lots of fun stuff like research and mentoring. While most STARS students are doing their own thing, most of us come together to provide tutoring hours for students taking 116 and 216, the first two Java classes that Computer Science students take in our department.

Last semester, I had a lot more students to tutor, but I started later in the semester. However, since the course is taught primarily through project-based learning, most of the "tutoring" I have to do is helping students debug their code or try to explain the requirements. Many of the students relied on the auto-grading tools to tell them if their code was right or wrong rather than developing unit tests of their own. All of this is unfortunate because as a volunteer, I don't actually follow the course progress even though I have access to the course website and projects, meaning that the only way I can help is by clearing up misconceptions, helping with programming constructs, and sharing attitudes that are valuable when approaching programming problems.

However, today's group was very, very different. This group did not rely on the autograding, they did not ask me to debug their code. They had concrete problems and misconceptions to clear up. They did not pressure me to give them the answer and patiently worked through the examples I gave them. When it came to problems with misunderstanding the requirements, they helped each other out.

I had so much fun.

While I love the thrill of sharing knowledge and seeing students grasp content, nothing can really compare to the sensation of hearing students express their gratitude for your help, especially when they recognize that you are doing so as a volunteer. It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. :)
