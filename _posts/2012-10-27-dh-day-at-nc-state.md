title: DH Day at NC State

Today I had the pleasure of attending Digital Humanities Day at NC State University - after all of the DH things I've been doing at Duke and Chapel Hill, it was nice to see something here at home. We had folks from several other Universities  come to join us, and I, as a Digital Humanities wannabe, <a href="http://storify.com/IsharaComix/dh-day-ncsu">livetweeted and Storified the whole thing</a>. It was rather short, running from 1 to 6, but it was still a full event.

The main focus of the talks were on tools available to Digital Humanists and the means of evaluating scholarship in the discipline. We went over a number of really awesome tools, like <a href="http://www.collex.org/">Collex</a>, a tool for aggregating metadata from artifacts such as <a href="http://www.nines.org/">19th Century Texts</a>. The purpose of an aggregator like Collex is to provide a one-stop research environment for academics who work in the same broad area. In addition to providing searching functionality, it also provides a front-end for crowdsourcing OCR error correction, allowing scholars to take part in the digitization process and assist one another. Collex is about forming a hub for a community of scholarship - something that's hard to do when you have very specific research interests, but easier when put out among the rest of the Internet.

Another neat tool that was discussed was a tool called <a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/">Juxta</a>, which I'll admit I didn't really get at first. From the way it looked, it just seemed like a way to do web-based diffs, which from a programmer's standpoint, doesn't seem particularly interesting. It wasn't until they told me the use-case that I got why it was <em>awesome</em>. When it comes to analyzing texts of pieces of literature, there can be differences between editions either due to editing decisions or even encoding mistakes. Because of this, it's very helpful to be able to see the two editions of the text side-by-side with their differences standing out. However, even better, it's possible to embed the Juxta visualization in a publication so that anyone reading can see how the author interpreted the differences between the texts by encoding the entire source file in their publication.

This is something that simply isn't possible in traditional, linear prose, which is one of the many topics discussed during the panel discussion that followed. From a certain perspective, it seems kind of weird that after developing a system as amazing as hypertext only to use it to improve the retrieval of citations using DOI. With hypertext, the prose doesn't have to stand on its own, but can embed rich data sets in the submission without losing any clarity. Page limits only mattered when proceedings are printed on dead trees - with digital media, concepts such as pages don't mean anything anymore. When people ask whether a blog post is equivalent to a journal article, they are asking the wrong question.

The reason why publications and presentations are used to measure a scholar is because they serve as physical, countable artifacts of the scholar's impact in the academic community. The problem with using these for the means of assessing the scholar is that while they are important, publications are a <em>metric for measuring</em> impact, and are not the <em>impact itself</em>. When evaluation gets hung up on the metric and not on what it intends to measure, it becomes locked into an era and difficult to change when the field grows up and evolves in the way it has with the Digital Humanities. For this reason, it's important for DH Scholars to define with their administrators how they should be measured from the get-go, rather than thinking about it after their assessment.

In all of my interactions with folks in DH, most of what I've heard about is the "digital" part, so I've seen a lot of technology and tools that Digital Humanists have been working on and working with, but I've heard surprisingly little about their workflow and research culture. While there was a little bit of talk about tools today, the final talk of the day by Dr. Laura Mandell gave me some insight into the work that Digital Humanists do, how they do it, and - in her opinion - what was wrong with it.

In Computer Science, collaboration is a key part of who we are, whether it seems that way or not. A lab is a place where people work together to run experiments, use tools, and put ideas together to learn new things and write publications about what they've learned. Even between labs - research is a very collaborative dialogue. Every paper I've read in Computer Science ends with a section providing directions for future work, providing the scaffolding for a new lab to take the research in a different direction if they see something novel that they can do with it.

Dr. Mandell called for her colleagues to adopt this same sense of collaboration, since Digital Humanities requires each scholar to provide something in which they have expertise towards the discovery of new knowledge. She called for the creation of Virtual Research Environments... online spaces for scholars to come together to share knowledge and help each other work in spite of the established norms of the discipline. I see very few Computer Science papers with a single author, but Humanities scholars focus on single-author journal articles and monographs to collaborative works, something that I simply can't grasp from where I sit on the disciplinary spectrum. Collaboration helps develop global thinking skills that allow us to see our own work from another perspective, something from which <em>all</em> researchers can benefit.

While I was the only Ph.D. student in the room for a while (and the only Computer Scientist for the whole time), I finally saw some of my colleagues from NC State's <a href="http://crdm.chass.ncsu.edu/">Communication, Rhetoric, and Digital Media</a> program join us for the final talk of the afternoon. I've met CRDM folks through our PFL teaching workshops, but this is the first time I got to see them in <em>their</em> environment. It was uncomfortable but exciting to be in a situation where I was not only <em>not</em> the expert, but almost completely irrelevant! It would be silly to say that I learned a lot about the Humanities as a discipline, but I did get a glimpse into their culture, and the best way to learn a culture is to be immersed in it. I'm sure that as I continue this adventure, I'll learn more.
