*On Thursday, October 4, 2012, I went to three spectacular events held across Duke University and UNC Chapel Hill. I couldn't bring myself to try to fit them all into a single blog post. Today's post is the second in the series, summarizing Dr. Thrun's talk on AI Cars and society.*

After a brief lunch in Durham, I returned to Duke's Divinity School to attend the second lecture in the Provost's lecture series in Information Futures, where we were joined by the exciting and personable <a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/">Dr. Sebastian Thrun</a>, a professor at Stanford and researcher with Google who has done spectacular things in AI from offering the 160,000-student AI course online to working on Google's self-driving car project.

The talk was kept at a high-enough level that I could follow it, but as far as spacial perception, video recognition, and path planning go, I could take it or leave it. It's fascinating material, but not something I could consider taking a class in because I'm far more interesting in the holistic way that humans learn rather than in the structured ways that machines learn. I'm willing to use machine learning concepts to a certain extent in my work, but I'm still more fascinated in using them as a way to learn about phenomena in the natural world. Yet, despite being in a completely different research area than me, I was immediately drawn into his discussion of the development of the self-driving car.

The reason why I liked Dr. Thrun's talks over... say... all of the talks I had ever been to see... is because he focused on the <em>impact</em> of his research as it is applied to the greater good of humanity. When he talked about the self-driving car, he talked about how he envisioned a society where less space is used to provide places for cars to park, fewer crowded roads, and fewer fatal car accidents. California has <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/09/26/1621200/california-legalizes-self-driving-cars">explicitly legalized</a> self-driving cars, and I can only imagine that highlighting these impacts of the technology over the academic "look at this cool thing we can do with computers" is what played a role in that decision.

"We can make a car that drives itself" is something that Computer Scientists get.

"We can save lives" is something that <em>everyone</em> gets.

Relevance is the keyword needed to help people understand the impact of technology. Many people, when confronted with a problem with a computer, throw their hands up in the air and say "someone get a Computer Scientist because I'm not good with computer". While this speaks to problems with basic computer literacy (a topic I'll explore tomorrow in Part 3), it also speaks to looking at the impact beyond the technology - a topic that many of my colleagues seem to lose sight of. It doesn't matter how specialized your research area is: there must be some way to apply it to improve society in some way. Finding how to articulate this benefit is how you make the public see the value in the work you do.

Which leads me to the theme of Dr. Thrun's talk: rethinking three societal norms in transportation, communication, and education. It's not about the technology itself. The technology is fun, but the social applications and consequences are what determine whether or not the technology was "successful". He briefly touched on the stylish <a href="https://plus.google.com/+projectglass">Google Glasses</a> and MOOC platform <a href="http://udacity.com">Udacity</a>, but it was his discussion on the self-driving car that brought these somewhat unrelated technologies together.

At first, I was disappointed that he wasn't going to talk more about Udacity, but I think I left the room far more enlightened about my own understanding of being a Computer Scientist by hearing him talk about something I normally would not have looked into or considered. Dr. Koller's talk on Monday was exciting, yes, but it didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know. Dr. Thrun's discussion, on the other hand, made me reflect on some of my own values and assumptions, which paved the way for the talk that started half an hour later, which I'll discuss tomorrow, wrapping up this bit of writing.

As one would expect from the folks behind this madness, the livetweets from this talk <a href="http://storify.com/adelinekoh/sebastian-thrun-technologies-for-a-mobile-society">were storified</a>, and the video is <a href="http://divinity.capture.duke.edu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=6d75a39a-9689-461e-8062-8cd81a3fda52">available here</a>.
