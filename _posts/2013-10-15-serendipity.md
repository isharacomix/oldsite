One of my favorite books is John Seely Brown's *A New Culture of Learning*. He
goes into some great detail on the idea of attention as a form of literacy,
how technology is changing the way humans interact, and draws the ultimate
comparison between two topics near and dear to my heart: learning and gaming.
Though this is a spoiler, his final thesis is essentially that Education can
learn from World of Warcraft, but I disagree quite a bit with some of his final
points.

He argues that the beauty of the internet is the ability to make friends with
people all over the world and form collectives and communities with them based
on our goals, ultimately resulting guilds that work together to quest, learn,
and become victories together. However, I disagree vehemently on this point. I
feel as though this is the wrong thing to attempt to nurture and capitalize on.
I believe what we need to incubate aren't the guilds, but the serendipitous
meetings between two people that, out of pure virtue of massivity, happen to be
doing the exact same thing at the exact same time.

I recently bought the Pokemon Y version for the 3DS, and Nintendo definitely
delivered on their promise to make the X and Y versions a Pokemon for the
Internet age. When playing Pokemon online, your bottom screen shows three groups
of people: your friends, 100 random passersby that happen to be online, and
a list of all the people on the Internet you have interacted with on some level
without making them friends (acquaintances). This is very interesting, as it is
now possible to trade and battle with people all over the world just because they
are online at the same time you are, essentially creating a Pokemon social network
from inside of the game.

That's really cool. Now, it's possible to, on a lark, start a battle with someone,
or use special powers to heal another players' Pokemon or increase their experience.
While it's very limited interaction, I feel like it's the right direction. Don't
put games on social networks, put social networks in games. Make it possible to
make friends within the game on the side of the game - with a bottom screen, it
fits in perfectly on the DS. It's natural - as natural as seeing some students in
the student lounge doing the same homework as you and creating an impromptu study
group.

This is the sort of thing I want to encourage in learning environments. Moodle,
Canvas, even Coursera, despite there being forums and tons of people, there is
no way to have spontaneous interactions like is possible in MMORPGs or on 
social media sites like Twitter. When I was talking about
[Tent](http://isharacomix.org/posts/2013/09/12/social-network-competition)
way back when, I suggested that something that would improve the game experience
would be embedding a social network for your games into the games. If every game
had a Twitter-like chat system, I'm not saying it would be great, but it would
be interesting. The same goes for things like learning management systems.
Forums are intimidating. Blog posts are intimidating. Status updates are not.

Sometimes just posting "I'm working on question 4 now" can lead to something
amazing. I want more of that to happen in education, since it might even be
able to lead to learning.
