Today was the last day of classes for the Fall Semester. The Computer Science seniors showed off their project demos at <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/news/1417">Posters and Pies</a>, and the <a href="http://stars.csc.ncsu.edu">STARS students</a> followed up by showing off the posters for their research and service projects. Today was the last day of <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalwritingmonth.com/">#digiwrimo</a>, and <a href="http://www.phd2published.com/2012/10/15/announcing-acwrimo/">#acwrimo</a> - which I <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/10/29/everyones-connected">tried</a> to participate in. 

Yesterday I held my last lab. I led 28 lab sessions this semester, which accounts for a total of nearly 56 hours of face time with my students. All in all, I was very happy with how I led my labs - it was rough and I made some mistakes, of course, but overall I think I did all right. Teaching has been the most amazing experience I've had since starting Grad School, and I really want the chance to do the class <em>right</em>. While we don't get news of TA appointments until the very end of the semester, I <em>was</em> able to respond to the call for summer teachers this year, meaning that I may get a chance to lead a "real course" come summer (as opposed to a lab). Since I got the qualifier out of the way, the teaching opportunities will only keep coming my way!

As far as scholarship goes, it's been a good semester. I finished a huge fellowship application and got two papers <em>accepted</em> this semester alone! If I can keep up this pace, I'll have three publications each year, which is pretty good if we're counting merit badges. I'm a little less impressed in my actual research impact, since it feels like I've done a lot of reading the research of others and not doing my own. However, when the semester was starting off, my research interests were broad and unfocused, and I've slowly drilled down to what it is that <em>I</em> care about doing. The courses I'll be taking next semester (those at State, <a href="http://hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson/2012/11/24/21st-c-literacies-digital-knowledge-digital-humanities-grad-class">the one at Duke</a>, <a href="https://www.canvas.net/courses/introduction-to-openness-in-education">and</a> <a href="http://moocmooc.com">three</a> <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/">MOOCs</a>) will certainly help lay the foundation for a productive research agenda.

Unfortunately, #acwrimo didn't turn out superbly. While I was off to a good start, cleaning up my entire To-Do list in the first week, I never actually got around to writing a paper (though I did submit an abstract to <a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/">the Journal of Online Teaching</a>... we'll just see how that one turns out). November, being at the end of the month, is just the time when I have to cut things that aren't paying my bills. I'm happy that most MOOCs run for the first three months of the semester, when I have more flexibility with my schedule. April and November are usually crunch time, when everything is due and nothing gets done. It's a sad fact of life, but life still goes on. I'm looking forward to casting aside the chains over Christmas and catching up on my reading so that I can be rejuvenated for research come January.

It'll all be behind me by this time next week. I'll give the demo for the final project of my machine learning class and then grade the final exams for Software Engineering. After that, I hop on a plane and head over to San Diego to present my research at <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12">USENIX LISA 2012</a>, which I'll be covering for <a href="http://opensource.com">Opensource.com</a>! It's crazy that my third semester in Grad School is already over. It feels like it was just yesterday that I took my qualifying exam.
