title: What are 'one-player' games?
---

When I read [Ian Bogost](http://twitter.com/ibogost)'s book *Racing the Beam*,
there was a particularly interesting part I came across regarding the perception
of video games as a social artifact. When video games were first developed, they
were developed with many of the same assumptions as other games: activities
for two or more people to engage in together. However, when arcade machines and
home consoles starting getting big, there was a need for games that people
could play against "the computer".

So, what I found most interesting was how Bogost deliberately paused when
talking about how the Atari developers were tasked with developing an AI player
for the game of *Pong*. He highlighted a shift in how games were perceived.
When did we decide that games are one player things? When did the second player
become something that we "added"? Most games I've played don't even support
split-screen anymore.

Yet, even when I played games like *The Legend of Zelda* and *Final Fantasy*, which
are ostensibly "one-player", I always found myself discussing the games when
I was at school. How they were designed, what I thought about the story, what
I thought was going to happen next, strategies for beating bosses... there was
always a social element at play - even for games that were designed as
individual experiences. It was like a "game" version of a book club. Rather
than getting together and playing games together, we would play games alone
and then discuss them when we were in class and away from our consoles.

Are there really any "one-player" games anymore? Were there ever any?

The Internet has made this social element even more interesting. Wikia hosts
a fan-made wiki for nearly every game out there, talking about plot, characters,
enemies, and items. Youtube has piles of "Let's Play" videos with commentary
by Internet personalities as they experience games for the first time. Modders
and hackers keep games going by creating new content when the original developers
have moved on. It's an interesting ecosystem of players. Even cellular automata
like the Game of Life have ridiculously extensive communities of research
around them.

Games are inherently social. But that makes me want to explore an even weirder
question...

Is it possible to play explicitly social games alone? What does a game of
*Dungeons & Dragons* look like when played by oneself? What about a MUD with
only one person on it? How do these worlds look? Can a player be their own
Dungeon Master? How does it differ from writing a book or a play? Can someone
prototype a "setting" in the same way as a game or a website?

It's a really weird question, and I care about it for some reason. I have no
idea why.
