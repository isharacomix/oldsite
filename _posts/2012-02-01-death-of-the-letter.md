title: Death of the Letter
---

To my dearest readers:

I've lightly touched on this subject before, but one thing that I really do lament these days is what I consider to be the slow death of the personal letter.

The beauty of the letter, as opposed to text messages, social networking status updates, and the like, is that the letter doesn't exist as a "fast" or "convenient" way of getting one's thoughts across. Instead, it is written at the leisure of its sender to be read at the leisure of the receiver, hopefully containing information that stands out beyond the temporary nature of contemporary communication. Text messages are a means of getting information to another party in the hopes of beating the fast-paced events of our society. When you ring up somebody's phone with a text message, you are forcing yourself to the front of their priorities, while a letter patiently waits for a weary soul to return home, not imposing itself on anyone.

There's no feeling quite like finding a personal letter in the mailbox after coming home from work or school. Everything I see is very impersonal or mechanical in nature, being magazine subscriptions, utility bills, or advertisements, to the point where an empty mailbox is often treated as a blessing. However, opening a letter written specifically with me in mind is a sensation like no other, and while it doesn't happen often, my family does write letters on occasion, and I make it a point to save them all, since letters are often timeless.

Unfortunately, society has made the letter somewhat unwelcome. Even when one is well-acquainted with a friend, it's considered particularly unusual to ask for their address for the purpose of writing them a letter (and if they know that it's for that reason, it ruins part of the charm). The only parties considered with mailing addresses these days are the billing and shipping departments of faceless corporations. The vehicle of communication has become the Internet, and my platform of choice has become plain-text e-mail.

I've done my very best to emulate my feelings of letters when writing them, by carefully crafting a salutation, a benediction, and in-between, an appropriately courteous body to convey my thoughts, even when writing for routine business purposes. E-mails are particularly attractive because they are free-form and don't have any kind of obstructive size limits, giving me the ability to express my thoughts sincerely and eloquently. While I won't put this kind of flourish in every reply I make to a thread of e-mails, I always do so for the initial, unsolicited message, if only to make a statement for the way I believe communication <i>should</i> be done.

Even e-mail is starting to die away, being considered a medium for newsgroup subscriptions and work-related communication, while the way to connect with your friends and loved ones is through social networking sites. I resist this change, as this would truly mark the end of well-thought out, written correspondence, as we try to express our thoughts to one another with a 160-character ceiling.

Valentine's day is coming up soon. If you want to do something novel, I suggest writing a letter.

Most sincerely,
Barry Peddycord III
