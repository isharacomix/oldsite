In my last entry, I mentioned that a good way to spend your free time is to work on your annotated bibliography, but I never mentioned exactly what that was. While I'm sure Wikipedia has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotated_bibliography">all-star definition of the word</a>, I have my own ideas about what that means and how to make it useful.

It's not like there's much to it. Basically, an annotated bibliography is a bibliography, but after each entry, you briefly describe the paper being mentioned. You put down the problem the authors solve, how they solved it, their contribution, and anything else that's of interest. It also helps to have a link to the article.

This serves as a quick reference for you when drafting your award-winning proof on how *P=NP*. You can quickly glance to see which articles you've actually read, where the paper is located online, and the $latex \LaTeX$ shortcode for your citation so you can splice it into your works-cited section without any trouble. If you keep your bibliography in LaTeX, then it's really easy to combine it with bibtex to speed up document printing.

In case it isn't immediately obvious of why it's such a useful tool, here are three reasons I can think of as to why it's important to keep one and keep it up-to-date.

### It gives you citations
One of the more frustrating parts of the academic paper is the "Previous Work" session, because we grad students are too busy with our own work to go and read <em>previous</em> work. But the industrious Ph.D. student keeps a running annotated bibliography categorized by topics so that he (or she!) can easily add citations to the paper without having to fire up <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>. Silliness aside, it helps greatly to be able to identify which papers talked about which subjects, as it makes it easy to slip in a <em>\cite{}</em> command into the paper to help reinforce your main points and avoid plagiarism.

### You stay up to date on research
It's important to stay on top of the current research, because you don't want to be the guy who tries to submit a dissertation on a topic that some other fool just published a paper on at the workshop last year. If you're lucky enough to have open-access conference proceedings in your field, it's a good idea to go through and read the papers in the tracks that you work in so that you know what other researchers are up to. Not only does it keep your mind sharp and thinking about the new ways that problems are being solved, it also saves you from looking like an idiot when you find that you're behind the times on the latest and greatest heuristics for solving the traveling salesman problem.

### It helps you learn names
Nothing is more embarrassing than finding yourself at a conference and asking "who's that guy talking up there?", only to have the fellow next to you slap you upside the head for being the uncultured buffoon you are. In every field, there are a few celebrities, and if you're a rookie grad student like me, it's important to learn their names and what kinds of amazing papers they've written. When you start to visit articles published in top conferences, you'll start to see the same names over and over again - if you see the same name more than once, it's in your best interest to match those names to papers and maybe Google-stalk them so you can find out what they look like for the next conference you go to.

With all of this advice at your disposal, fire up LaTeX and start up your own annotated bibliography! You won't regret it!
