title: Backbreaking Community Service
---

Today was [National Wolfpack Service Day](http://www.alumniblog.ncsu.edu/2011/10/07/wake-county-alumni-have-20-events-for-service-day/), a day where NCSU Alumni, Students, and Faculty from around the nation get together to do volunteer work in their local communities. From helping with open house to picking plants in community gardens, today was a busy day in Wake County where we all got together to spend time in fellowship and community service. It was pretty cool.

I found myself helping out with the [Hemlock Bluffs](http://www.hemlockbluffs.org/) in Cary, and even though it wasn't my first choice of work site, I'm *very* happy that I ended up going there. It was an absolutely beautiful sight, and I was able to actually help out with what I was doing. Hemlock Bluffs is an interesting entity in that it's a Federal Reserve, but it's run by the Town of Cary, and it is supported almost entirely by volunteer labor. Especially during fall, when foot traffic starts to rise, they need help to keep the park running smoothly, so they get folks to do things like re-mulch the trails and whatnot. Our job was to replace the planks on one of the boardwalks.

In the flood plain of the park, they have a boardwalk that gets pretty soaked, and as such, the wood starts to rot to the point where it's dangerous to walk on it. So occasionally, old planks have to be pulled out and new planks nailed in. As an added challenge, we had to ensure that we didn't lose any old nails, since having those lying around could be problematic, so each plank required us to carry it down the hill, remove the old one and all the nails, nail down the new one, carry the old one back to the the top of the hill and (finally) put it in the dumpster.

With our small army of about 10 volunteers, we were able to lay down 50 new planks in a little over 2 hours, which isn't too bad. I haven't done any real physical labor since I moved away from my parents and grandparents, so it felt good to work my muscles and actually get covered in enough dirt and sweat to actually feel like I *needed* to take a shower. It was a fulfilling way to spend a morning, even though I pretty much went the day on an empty stomach (since they didn't really provide the most filling breakfast in the world).

It didn't only feel good because I was outside, working in nature. It also felt good because everyone who was walking the path that we were repairing made it a point to thank us for what we were doing. It didn't feel like we were doing busy work that didn't really make a difference. Our toil was appreciated both by the management and the patrons of the park, and when we could see the boardwalk change from slighty-rotten-looking to a fresh wooden color, it was easy to look at it and say "Yeah. We did that. It was cool."

Today was a great day. I was exhausted by the end of it, and that is a *good feeling*, because it means it was a day well-spent.

Also: **Tomorrow we make fish.**
