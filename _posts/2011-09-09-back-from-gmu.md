title: Back from GMU!

For the past few days, I just had the pleasure of attending a MURI Meeting with some of the professors and grad students from my department. Even though I've just started and haven't really done anything profound, this is the second time that I've been flown out somewhere and offered food on someone else's dime. The meeting was very inspiring and has rekindled my motivation to get some cool stuff done.

MURI stands for Multi-University Research Initiative, which is a grant that (as it's name implies) brings together folks from different Universities and disciplines to work together towards solving a big problem. The meeting was hosted at [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu), and featured folks from [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu/), [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon](http://www.cmu.edu), [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/), [UC Berkley](http://berkeley.edu/), [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/), and good old NCSU. The meeting itself was essentially an annual progress report where the PIs for each University talked about their accomplishments and their future work, bringing everyone (including the funding agencies) up to speed on what's going on.

So this means that for the first time, I got to see first-hand that there *are* people who care about the research that I'm doing, and now that I know what they want from me, I have a better idea of what direction to go where I can actually do some good for somebody (besides just paying for my tuition). Seeing the big picture helps me figure out that I'm not just going in some random direction in the dark. I don't know about everyone else, but going to these conferences and workshops always help reinforce the fact that I've made the right choice in going for the Ph.D. Sometimes after spending eight hours in the lab, I feel disillusioned with my work and feel pretty unsure of myself. But getting to see these folks present and hear their ideas always helps me come up with ways to move forward when I head back. It's a really good feeling.

The conference organizers didn't pay for us to eat like they did at Carnegie Mellon in the summer, but I ended up eating out with my professor and some other colleagues from State while I was out. We ate Chinese, but ate it Chinese-style, where there's a communal plate of food and everyone gets portions for their own plate, kind of like a potluck. I'm really hesitant about this kind of dining - not because I'm scared of trying new things (remember, this is the new, open-minded Barry), but because it feels awkward to eat food that someone else has paid for. Feels like I'm imposing on someone else, and I really can't stand that.

I tried some "actual Chinese food" (as opposed to the Americanized Chinese food) and some of it was good and some of it wasn't so good. I had a really nice spicy beef stir-fry, as well as some cooked lamb that I enjoyed. Among other things, I gave tofu a shot, but really couldn't stand the texture. I tried a lot of things, but right now, I'm really in the mood for some fried chicken.
