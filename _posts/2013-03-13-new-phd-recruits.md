title: New Ph.D. Recruits
---

I haven't blogged in such a long time. Between coding #8bitmooc, attending SIGCSE, and all that fun stuff, I just have not had the time. I figure I should at least write about something, though...

This weekend, I had the opportunity to show some of the Ph.D. students who had already been accepted to our program around the campus. These were students who had already been offered three years of funding, so we weren't interviewing them so much as they were interviewing us. While there was a substantial amount of fun social events around campus, the real sell of any graduate institution are the faculty and students who will become your mentors and colleagues when you join in. The recruits spent the first day of the tour sitting with our professors and asking them about their research and lab culture, trying to find potential advisors before the semester began. The next day, we went to the College of Engineering Open House and toured around Historical Main Campus. It was a very good time.

I had a wonderful time helping out - the students were all very bright and would definitely make a great fit in our department. Many research interests were represented, especially security and data-mining, which have become some of the largest research tracks in our department. However, more than anything, I feel like having a chance to speak candidly with the students in the department and seeing just how passionate we are about our work is the biggest way to sell the department. I certainly hope that's how I came across when I was talking about what I did.
