Last week, I had the distinct pleasure of attending a discussion and networking event with the fine folks from <a href="http://nctech4good.org">NCTech4Good</a>, a group of technically inclined people based here in my hometown of Raleigh who use their talents to assist non-profits in whatever technology-related issues they have. This includes things such as setting up websites, establishing a presence on social networking sites, and generally assisting them with building the infrastructure needed for outreach, education, and collaboration with the public and within their own membership. It was a very different perspective on technology that was very exciting to see.

I've never heard the word "Drupal" more times in one sitting. It was so amazing seeing these folks who aren't part of the discipline of Computer Science talking about websites, infrastructure, and even Creative Commons so naturally. At first it was very surreal, since I knew these folks were talking with authority on the technology they were using, but I couldn't figure out what made them so different from my colleagues in the University.

Then it hit me.

My peers in the University speak from the viewpoint of being <strong>developers</strong>. Java is a terrible language because it's Java! Agile is the way to develop software! I think I'll write my next program in Go because it's new and hip! Eclipse is the worst IDE ever made!

You seldom hear hear bright-eyed computer science students talking about how to apply and leverage technology to make a difference in the world. They want to make their own software that will change the way we look at computers forever, but it's telling when the first answer that a person has about their new tool isn't what problem it solves, but rather, what language it's written in. Developers are like artists, building a massive program to be as beautiful and fun as it is useful. But this isn't what users are thinking about, especially in the context of non-profits. Developers don't have to deal with the implications of having their volunteer webmaster go away, taking all of the skills needed to maintain the website with him. They can figure it out - or better yet - just install their favorite CMS (Wordpress 4evr). I think this plays a role in how detached and hostile developers are to towards their userbase.

The folks I met with NCTech4Good were technologically competent, but also had good business sense. They understand the overhead with installing new technology and training people to use it, and can't afford to just go with a certain language or platform because all the cool kids are using it. They recognize that users of technology don't need technological evangelism, and they certainly don't care about whether your CMS has a Turing-Complete scripting language. They need a tool for the job that they are trying to accomplish, and when tools become clunky, bloated, and unintuitive, they just aren't effective.

Technology, more than anything else, is a medium for communication. It allows a group to make its message loud and clear to the rest of the world, and allows a globally distributed team to collaborate and coordinate their effects. Working with groups like these can help us as developers generate tools that will empower non-technical users and help them realize that just because it's on a computer doesn't mean that it's inaccessible to them.

This isn't just a local thing, either. There is a national organization that does the same general thing as NCTech4Good, called <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN</a>. They hold an annual conference on the subject of helping nonprofits utilize technology, which is a pretty amazing subject, in my opinion. I would love to try to make it out there one year, but sadly, it's not an "academic" conference, so I'd probably have a hard time convincing the University to cover my travel.
