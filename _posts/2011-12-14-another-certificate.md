title: Another Certificate!
---

Since I started Grad School, I've been really busy - not only with classes and research, but also sharpening my professional skills and working on my social network. I've been getting involved with the local section of the <a href="http://ieee.org">IEEE</a>, even running for the position of Section Secretary for the year of 2012. I've also been participating the <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/preparing-future-leaders/index.php">Preparing Future Leaders</a> program, an initiative by our Graduate School and Office of Post-Doctoral Affairs to assist Grads and Post-Docs in teaching, research, and professional skills. This blog post is about the latter.

The Season Pass is an initiative to help Graduate Students (and Post-Docs, but I'm going to focus on Graduate Students) take advantage of the numerous free workshops that various faculty in our University provide regarding Fundamentals in Teaching, Professional Development, and Responsible Conduct in Research. These three major categories make up the University's Preparing Future Leaders program. I've been to quite a variety of workshops and seminars, mostly involving teaching, but a few on other subjects. As someone who wants to become a Professor (as I've said in my earlier entries), I need to make sure that I can build up a teaching portfolio that can help complement my research publications if I want to be taken seriously when I start applying for jobs. However, the Season Pass encouraged me to look at the Professional Development seminars which I would have just skimmed over under normal circumstances. As much as I love the fact that the University offers workshops like that, I wasn't exactly interested in them.

But I'm glad that I went to them anyway. They were excellent experiences for me, since the conversations and questions that follow the lectures give me some excellent insight into the professional aspect of the academic world. As it turns out, when you're looking for a job, nobody wants someone who's really smart but totally aloof and engrossed in his work. You have to get tenure before they put up with that kind of thing.

I missed the lecture on "How to Dress for Success", which was disappointing, but I did get to go to one on public speaking, one on procrastination, and a last one on informational interviews. I found them all very useful, and I, for one, am very pleased with this usage of our hard-earned tuition money. It's a great way for the University to help its Graduate population in particular, since I've noticed that it's a very different world, as a grad student, both in the academic aspect as well as in the social aspect - you don't really identify with the incoming freshmen with dreams of going off to a dream company and making a success out of your life. Instead, you relate better to the tired and drowsy Post-Docs trawling along the hallways like zombies, kept alive only by a meager-but-steady infusion of caffeine and research funding.

Speaking of the social aspect, another great thing about these seminars is that it gives Grad Students from different departments a chance to mingle with one another, since we're normally stuck in our labs from dawn to dusk, with the only company being the folks in the cubicles on either side of us. Being a computer scientist, I've gotten to meet folks in the College of Education, the Biology Department, the Mathematics Department... it's been very nice to branch out of my normal circle of contacts and meet these folks from around the campus. Very nice, indeed.
