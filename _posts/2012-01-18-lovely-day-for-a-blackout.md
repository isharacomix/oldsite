title: Lovely Day for a Blackout
---


<a href="http://deviantart.com">deviantArt</a> didn't do much, but they put a button where they normally put their advertisements prompting users to go to discussion to talk about both sides of the SOPA issue. I didn't actually read the discussion because the commenting system on dA doesn't handle long threads very well. There were over 2000 comments on that debate. So they saw it.

Heck, even the My Little Pony fan-site <a href="http://equestriadaily.com">Equestria Daily</a> put censor bars in their header image, showing that even niche sites were willing to tell their users "Hey. This is important." All of these people saw these protests. It may have only been a little hiccup - it certainly could have used some more backing - but it shows that when different sites work together, we can put forth information.

"Nerd-sites" like <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>, <a href="http://gnu.org">GNU</a>, <a href="http://fsf.org">the FSF</a>, and the like all went down... not so much to inform their users, but more for solidarity. I'm willing to bet that anyone who has these sites in their favorites was aware of SOPA and PIPA way back when they were first being considered. By standing strong with each other, it helps keep morale up to continue fighting the good fight. This is why I blacked out my site, since I didn't expect to sway anyone's opinion, but by standing with the others, it makes things a bit less rough.

So did you do anything special for the blackout today?
