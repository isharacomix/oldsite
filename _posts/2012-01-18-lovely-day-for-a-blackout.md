title: Lovely Day for a Blackout
---



"Nerd-sites" like <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>, <a href="http://gnu.org">GNU</a>, <a href="http://fsf.org">the FSF</a>, and the like all went down... not so much to inform their users, but more for solidarity. I'm willing to bet that anyone who has these sites in their favorites was aware of SOPA and PIPA way back when they were first being considered. By standing strong with each other, it helps keep morale up to continue fighting the good fight. This is why I blacked out my site, since I didn't expect to sway anyone's opinion, but by standing with the others, it makes things a bit less rough.

So did you do anything special for the blackout today?
