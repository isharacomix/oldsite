So apparently Wordpress is going to start motivating me to write more by giving me "milestones" to post for. This marks my 45th blarg entry. Hooray! To celebrate, my brother and I made some Candy Sushis! Inspired by the fine folks at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUku7zAXVE">Epic Meal Time</a>, I bought more candy last night than I've bought since I moved into my apartment. I think this little snack easily exceeded the sweetness level of the Butterscotch Bourbon Bars I made a few months back.

So in theory, this Candy Sushi dish was supposed to be pretty simple. Take some marshmallow-coated-crispy-rice (the rice) and pad it on some fruit-flavored-candy-sheets (the seaweed). Wrap that around some sour-gummy-strips (the tuna), and dip it in some green-coloured cake icing (the wasabi). Note how I carefully described the ingredients without mentioning any of the brand names! It sounds pretty easy, right?

Well, this turned out to be one of the most involved things I've ever put together - dessert or otherwise. While my first shot at lasagna may have turned out like a mess, at least it turned out to be a mess that still somewhat resembled lasagna. My first attempt at this was an absolute disaster. I wasn't aware that the recipe I had for making the marshmallow-covered-rice was designed to use the microwave, so I was absolutely terrified that I was going to have exploded marshmallows all over the place.

To make matters worse, I tried to combine four of the fruit-flavored-candy-sheets into one big roll (like in the video) so I could get a total of 6 slices off of them. However, by the time we finished heating up the marshmallow coating, the candy sheets had already stuck to the plate, making it absolutely impossible to roll it up. Not to mention we used WAY too much rice. It ended up badly (though it was still delicious enough to eat).

So we tried it again, this time, only using one candy sheet at a time. This was much, much better. We were able to use the non-stick plastic that they were packaged on in order to avoid having them stick to the plate, and we would peel them off as we wrapped them around the rice and gummies. After doing this, cutting them with a steak knife created what looked more-or-less like little sushi rolls. We then set them up, got our wasabi, and set ourselves up to chow down on more sugar than any adult should have in one sitting.
