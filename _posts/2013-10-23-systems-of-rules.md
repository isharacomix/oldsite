title: Systems of Rules
---
One of my favorite games of all time is Pandemic. It's a cooperative board game
where all the odds are against the player. It's a strategic game where you have
to maximize the resources to cure the diseases infecting the world, racing against
a ticking clock and keeping the chaos under control. Much of the game's decisions
are about balancing mobility and containment, which all have to be done based on
the stastical probabilities that an outbreak or some other horrible incident will
occur. When you know the rules, you can make informed decisions that help mitigate
risk, with still just enough uncertainty to keep you on your toes. 

I like to look at games the way I look at programming languages. For some people,
games are fun because they simulate experiences or tell great stories. For me,
I view games as *systems of rules*. For me, a game's rules define its space of
possibilities, and I get the most pleasure from exploring and learning the full
space about what is possible and being able to draw from that knowledge quickly
and accurately. Ostensibly, I should really like and do well in strategy games,
but I have a big weakness - I have absolutely no foresight. In long term
strategy games like *Age of Empires* and *Civilization*, I've never been able
to balance the acquisition of resources and development of defences well enough
to position myself for the endgame.

On the other hand, tactical games like *Final Fantasy Tactics* and *Fire Emblem*
are much more interesting for me. In these games, I know all the rules and I'm
given a puzzle to solve with a fuzzy solution: given an initial setup of units
and environment, complete the victory objectives while minimizing losses. Even
in a situation where victory (or defeat) is guaranteed, the goal of "minimizing"
and "doing my best" gives me enough excitement to enjoy the game regardless since
winning is fundamentally governed by knowing the rules of the game and the
capabilities of my opponent and my units. Whenever my brother plays games, even
games like *Pokemon*, he'll turn to me when it comes to the tactical decisions
of when to attack and when to switch based on the probabilities of what the
opponent will do. It's about minimizing loss, even when victory is assured.

This is why I absolutely love *Pandemic*. In pandemic, the best course of action
changes every time a card is drawn, and there's very little to set up in advance.
Every turn is a reaction to the draw, and making the best reaction is what I
love about the game. Furthermore, because it's cooperative, I get a chance to
share information during the other players' turns and spin my gears even when
I'm technically not playing. The uncertainty of the card flips and the 

Wouldn't it be cool, then, to play a strategy game with procedurally generated
rules? The fun of the game comes from learning the rules and then mastering them.
But what if the rules change? When playing a game like *Halo*, the first time
you encounter the Herculean Hunters, you stand back and observe their behavior.
By the time you get to Halo 3, you run against them and shoot them right in the
sweet spot. If the rules of the game are keeping the player on their toes, they
have to maintain a constant state of learning while demonstrating what they have
learned staying alive!

I'm mostly just ranting right now. I think there are lots of cool directions for
this to go, from procedurally generated rules in games to procedurally generated
programming languages where new constructs are created based on how people use
it (in fact, don't new libraries do this already? The space expands as the
language is used).
