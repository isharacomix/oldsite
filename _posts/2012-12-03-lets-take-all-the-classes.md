title: Let's take ALL the classes!

During my first two semesters, I took three classes each semester in order to quickly get my required classes out of the way. This semester, I only took one, so that I would have time to do some preliminary research and solidify my research direction. Next semester... I'm taking <em>six</em>.

Well, OK, that might be a bit of an exaggeration since Hybrid Pedagogy's <a href="http://moocmooc.com">MOOCMOOC</a> is only a one-week course, but that still leaves five. I talked about the two classes I decided to take at NC State <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/10/26/next-semesters-schedule-no-csc">in an earlier blog post</a>, but since then, a bunch of new classes have made it onto my radar, and I simply couldn't allow them to slip by.

The first class is one being led by none other than Dr. Cathy Davidson, <a href="http://hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson/2012/11/24/21st-c-literacies-digital-knowledge-digital-humanities-grad-class">21st Century Literacies: Digital Knowledge, Digital Humanities</a>. This class, cross-listed in Duke University's English and Information Science + Information Studies departments is a course on teaching and research in the new paradigm of the Social Web. Dr. Davidson opened up five seats to non-Duke students, so I took the initiative of filling out NC State's Inter-Institutional Registration paperwork and enrolled in the program (I even have an <em>@duke.edu</em> email address now!). The class is heavily interactive, focused on peer-teaching and learning, and will most definitely be worth the weekly ride to Durham.

The next three on the list are MOOCs, two of which are meta-MOOCs. <a href="http://www.moocmooc">MOOCMOOC</a> is a mini-meta-MOOC offered for just one week early, in January. Developed by the fine folks at <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/">Hybrid Pedagogy</a>, an open-access Journal... blogging... thing. In fact, many of their projects are hard to quantify and classify because they are just so novel and insightful. MOOCMOOC, starting us off, will segue nicely into the <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/">OLDS-MOOC</a>, a MOOC on 21st Century Learning Design. Both of these MOOCs will take place across a wide range of platforms, mostly Social Media such as Twitter and Google+. Teaching a MOOC through example seems the best way to recruit our talented designers to hop aboard, doesn't it?

Finally, in a subject near-and-dear to my heart, I'll be enrolling in Canvas.net's <a href="https://www.canvas.net/courses/introduction-to-openness-in-education">Introduction to Openness in Education</a>. This is a more "streamlined" MOOC - taking place using the Canvas LMS, an experience similar to that of taking a course on Coursera or Udacity's platforms. M<strong>O</strong>OCs, or Massively <strong>Open</strong> Online Classes, all have varying degrees of openness. "Open" is a loaded word that means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I look forward to the discussions in this class on openness, whether it means it in terms of access, licensing, or participation in the design of the material.

The most exciting part about all six of the classes I'm taking next Spring is that in many of them, I expect to be among the few Computer Scientists in their ranks. Being around other Computer Scientists is comfortable and familiar... and that's a huge problem. They think the same way I do and they make the same assumptions I make. I can't mature as a scholar in an echo chamber, and these environments where I have to discuss and communicate with people in completely different disciplines are guaranteed to make me uncomfortable, make me reflect, and help me grow.

At first, I was worried that by going to all of these interdisciplinary classes and labs, I was broadening my research to the point where I wasn't sure if I'd be able to make a dissertation out of it. After all, the dissertation is about doing <em>one thing</em> nobody else has ever done and proving that it was worth it. Taking a wide variety of classes doesn't mean I'm doing too many things - it means that I'm looking at one thing from <em>many different perspectives</em>. I can't be accused of tunnel vision when I make a conscious effort to look at my research through the projects of others.
