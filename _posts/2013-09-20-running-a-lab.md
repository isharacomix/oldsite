title: Running a Lab

On Fridays, my lab has its weekly progress report meetings. I've taken on the
internal job of lab secretary, so I lead them and ensure that they run smoothly
and efficiently. I'm happy I've got this job, since I'd be doing it anyway, so
it's nice to be recognized for it. One of the most important ingredients to a
healthy lab is communication between its members, and while I see Reading Groups
as a prime way for us to stay in touch with one another, it's still pretty
sub-optimal.

Now if I had my way, the lab would be using [Github](http://github.com) for
everything. We all know how much I love Github - I run my website on Github,
I take all my notes on Github wikis, and I use Gists the same way most people
use Google docs. Github works in my workflow, lets me use all of my devices,
and doesn't make me worry about lock-in since I can take my repos and set them
up elsewhere if Github ever vanishes in a poof of smoke (I *really* hope they
don't do that, though). Github is great, even though for a website dedicated
to social coding, I do most of everything on it by myself.

In an ideal world, an entire lab could run on Github. Our website and blog
could be powered by a repo that tells the world what we do. Our papers can
be written and peer reviewed in private repositories. We can create a database
of knowledge for writing papers and grants on wikis, and set up an issue tracker
to delegate tasks to lab members. It would be the most perfect thing in all the
world, but the world is not ideal since Github is not a part of everyone's
workflow - much of the lab's code is kept in [Assembla](http://assembla.com)
since not all of it is public, and not many of us come from the world of helping
in Open Source, so the barrier to adopting it may be worth it, but it's still
there.

However, recently, I had what happened to be the best idea ever, which was
to have everyone put their communications in a different tool - a tool called
[Piazza](http://piazza.com). Piazza is a message board/question and answer
platform designed to be used in classes, and is pretty neat. Basically it
looks like an e-mail application, where all of the class posts are listed on
the left sidebar, and can be viewed, responded to, and edited on the right.
Private posts can be written to users, and appear in the stream alongside
everthing else, and important posts can be pinned to the top of the stream by
the Professor. Basically it's like a group e-mail platform, and it is quite
possibly the greatest thing.

First of all, it stops the lab from having to use e-mail, which is a noble goal
in and of itself. In today's world, e-mail is so overused that it's impossible
to get any meaningful communication out of it. When you have massive reply-all
threads where the entire conversation is copied in every reply, it becomes
ridiculous to have to sort through it all. In Piazza, unread messages are
brought to your attention so you can see exactly what's new, and conversations
are threaded so that you don't have the reply-all duplication you have in
e-mail.

Secondly, it serves as a resource for future reference. E-mail may have some
archival value, but it's terribly unfriendly and not worth it to try to clean
it up. Piazza posts, on the other hand, basically serve as wikis, as they can
be edited by instructors and students alike in order to ensure that only the
most important messages are left for everyone to see, and anything else is
trashed to avoid clutter. This makes it possible to create important pages such
as calendars, and have them appear above reminders and announcements to the
lab.

Finally, it fits in peoples' workflows. Our advisor loves Piazza and uses it
for all of her classes. Anyone who's a TA for her or in one of her classes
therefore uses it to see announcements and conversations. Part of making a tool
useful is picking a platform that you log onto frequently *anyway*. If you log
into Piazza every day, which many of us do, we will automatically notice the
notifications related to the lab when we check up on our classes, and vice versa.

Github may have lost, but Piazza won, and since Piazza killed e-mail, I am very
happy in spite of all of that. Thanks to our adopting Piazza, I know so much
more about what everyone in the lab is doing, and feel like I'm out of the loop
much less often. Piazza has supplanted our e-mail list, keeps us on schedule,
reminds us of papers, and keeps us communicating, making this the most natural
and comfortable team experience I've ever had.

Now if I could just get everyone on IRC, that would be a victory among victories.
