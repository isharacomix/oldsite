title: Gaming as a Grad Student
tags: blog
---
Ever since I left high school, I've become a much more infrequent gamer. Despite
playing games for so many hours in the day that taking away my console was a
credible threat by my parents, my gaming in college came pretty close to
non-existant. Now that grad school has rolled around and I'm a kind of real
grown up with responsibilities, I don't play that much, but might break out a
board game I really like every once in a while.

While I could write about my love of video games from a research and teaching
perspective, I'll save that for another day. Instead, I want to write about how
my brain processes gameplay. There's been a big push these days for "open world
infinite sandbox" games, especially in the indie world. While most people are
content to make a game with a narrative arc from beginning to end, there is a
constant flux of games that attempt to be what *[Minecraft][]* was - no goal,
simple mechanics, and a million times the size of the Earth. Games have upped
the ante, with *[Starbound][]* featuring an infinite number of infinite planets,
and *[Limit Theory][]* pushing the limits even further with a living AI that
governs life in the endless void of space.

Don't get me wrong, I love these games. They are technical marvels and tons of
fun to play. The idea is that you can play them at your own pace, and every time
you come back, you experience something new in a somewhat familiar world. You
can make your encampment in *Minecraft* and then sail to another continent, or
you can fly to a new planet after stripmining the one you're on in *Starbound*.
In theory, these are the perfect games for me.

In practice, however, these games reward a certain mindset. The mindset of people
who can start big projects and keep hammering away at them. Whether it's
exploring the universe or building a Turing Machine, you are rewarded for
patience and perserverance. There is no immediate payoff for someone in these
games. You have to work to make your empire (unless you cheat and use a map
editor).

In my case, I only get to play a game for a short period of time and very
infrequently. When I've been gone for a week or so and then come back to a
game like Minecraft, the last thing I want to do is think about where I was in
some project that I made up for myself. I want to be able to start a game,
enjoy the experience, and be able to close up the experience without leaving
anything hanging when I have to leave the game for a long time again. This is
why I've started enjoying board games a lot more.

When you're a kid, the last thing you want is for a game to end. A game is
escapism from a boring world where you have no power to do the things you want.
I can't say how many RPGs I simply stopped advancing in past the point of no
return. I didn't do the side quests because I was a completionist, I did them
because I just didn't want to see the game end. I wanted to spend more time in
the world and with the characters. If I had *Minecraft* and *Starbound* back
then, I'd be ecstatic. Now, I'm not so sure.

During one of my streams, I started pontificating about a game that takes place
in an infinite universe, but instead of the focus being on editing the world and
making your mark, the game would instead be cast in short vignettes with clear
narrative structure within the world. The stories would be generated randomly,
but the world would remain the same. This would allow you to play stories that
feature familiar characters and take as long or short as necessary to complete
them. One of my all-time favorite games, *[Gearhead RPG][]*, is very close to
this. The world is hand-made, with randomly generated dungeons and maps hidden
within it. There are predefined story arcs and sidequests with unique characters,
but the plot that guides your character is shuffled together with randomly
selected components.

One thing I'm really looking forward to in *Rules of War* is developing a story
editor for a campaign mode. While I likely couldn't make a campaign myself, it
would be great to see what others make if this game ever gets up off the ground.
There's no reason why a tactical game should be any less immersive than a
one-player adventure game, as I've learned from great games like *Advance Wars*,
*Fire Emblem*, and *Final Fantasy Tactics*.
