title: Pumpkin Piecakecookiesomething
---

It's the weekend again. This time, instead of making a hot and fancy dinner, I decided to do something a little different and fix up what were supposed to be Pumpkin Cookies. However, they were supposed to be cookies in the sense of brownies, where you bake them in a big pan and cook them up. They turned out really good, but turned into more of a cakish-pie thing than anything else. I owe this to numerous issues with my preparation.

First of all, I used waaaaaay too much pumpkin with not nearly enough flour. So even though it managed to be slightly more consistent than pie, it was still very squishy. I only used about two cups of flour with 30 oz. of pumpkin, and yeah... that turned out to be quite blarg. Additionally, I filled the cake pan with too much of it, and should have split it between two pans. I was afraid that it would have been spread too thin, but then again, maybe not. I could probably get it just right if I was to go and do it again with only half as much pumpkin, but now I've got a whole great big cake to eat so I might as well just go ahead and finish this off. Maybe I'll give it another shot at Thanksgiving. I dunno.

So now comes the big question. What to fix next? I've been thinking of buying myself one of those countertop grills and maybe fixing some salmon. That would be a really flavorful way to spice up dinnertime, with some actual meat. Even though frying is nice and southern and all, I really can't stand fried and breaded fish, so if I could grill it without all the trouble of actual grilling, that would be so awesome! I could fix fish and maybe some broccoli and rice or something and that would be so very, very delicious.

It's kind of weird how this grad school blog has sort of turned into a cooking blog. Since I can't really talk about unpublished science, I guess I find it more fun to just talk about foodstuffs. Well, that and ham radio.
