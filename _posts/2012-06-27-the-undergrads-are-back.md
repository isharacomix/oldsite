title: The Undergrads Are Back
---

It's that time of year again... <em>orientation week</em>. The time when the bright-eyed freshman are exploring the university, the place that will become their home away from home for the next four to six years. Those were simpler times. The innocence... the sense of wonder and excitement... it sure takes me back...

Oh wait... no it doesn't.

Undergrad was a pretty miserable time for me. I didn't have a very clear idea about what I wanted to do with my life or where I wanted to go - all I knew is that I wanted a degree. I wanted to get a degree in Computer Science and I wanted to do something like work for Red Hat maybe. This was back during the days when I was completely incapable of human interaction, and actually preferred to be by myself for long periods of time. Even when I made some friends, I still felt pretty out-of-place.

Funny how things change, isn't it? Now I'm only somewhat incapable of human interaction.

They always say that in high school you're forced to be around people you don't really connect with, but it'll be different when you go to college. The people you meet in college make better friends for two reasons: they are interested in the same things you are since they're most likely in the same major, and they're dedicated to their education at some level (which is always a positive character trait). I met a lot of smart, confident, and amazing computer scientists and engineers, and yet I still felt totally out of place. Part of it had to do with my isolated childhood while another part had to do with the fact that I lived off-campus and couldn't interact with the rest of my classmates outside of class.

But when I started Grad School, two things changed. Firstly, I was no longer kept away from interacting with my classmates and colleagues. I had a car, an apartment, and control over my schedule. I was free to attend talks, join clubs, do service with my department, and go out to dinner with my buddies. If I decided I wanted to go out and do something, <em>I could</em>. And rather than choosing to go out to party, I decided to connect with local professionals in groups like the IEEE and the LUG instead.

On an even more profound level, beginning a career as an academic allowed me to connect with people I could really identify with. Even though each Grad Student is studying something wholly unique and disconnected from everyone else, we all understand what our academic peers are going through. It's not about getting the technical details of each others' work. It's about knowing that we came to Grad School to pursue something we cared about. We're here because we wanted to be here. In general, Grad School is something that either requires a lot of sacrifice or a lot of luck to attend, so everyone who is going through it is doing so because they see value in it. It's true here, it was true at the workshop at Carnegie-Mellon, it was true at the conference in Bonaire. "Grad Students" is the first social group I've ever felt as though I truly "fit in".

It's a shame that the Undergrads who will be joining us in the fall won't be able to truly appreciate the accomplishments of our University until just before they leave. While they're watching the basketball and football games, our institution is making breakthroughs in research, and changing the world.

Our <strong><em>Grad Students</em></strong> are changing the world.
