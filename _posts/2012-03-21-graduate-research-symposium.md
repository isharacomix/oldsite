title: Graduate Research Symposium
---

The Graduate Research Symposium was held yesterday, and boy, was it a party. We had 178 Graduate Students from across the campus show up and bring a poster with the intention of letting everyone know why they decided to come to school for another two to four years of work. We had an excellent group of very smart people here, all representing the best of the University's research population. It was an honor getting to present my work on behalf of the Department of Computer Science, and I sincerely hope that others felt the same way.

This was the seventh year that our Graduate School, with the help of our active Graduate Student Association, has run the symposium, and it attracts folks from all around the area to see what our bright young students are working on. We even had some of the state representatives for our county in attendance, and they congratulated the students on a job well done.

There was a prize for the top three posters in each general area of study. I didn't win. But I honestly didn't expect to - my current research project doesn't go particularly well on a poster - and I had a lot of information to cram into my little two-minute presentation. But for the casual folks who dropped by, including my former professor and Director of Graduate Programs for the Department of Computer Science, I had the opportunity to explain my work at my own pace, and probably got the point across much better.

The duty of a researcher is twofold: while researchers are expected to do work and create new knowledge, they are also charged with the responsibility of disseminating it. While we do that to some extent with publications and presentations at conferences, we also have a responsibility to show our work to the local community as well. After all, they support us by funding our public universities, so it's only right that they have the opportunity to see what we are doing, and that what we are doing is relevant in <em>their</em> daily lives.

Sadly, it seems as though my colleagues are too wrapped up in their work to publicize their work in this way - our department only had three out of our maximum of four presenters attend. While I respect the fact that the Ph.D. is a heavy commitment and doesn't leave a lot of time to go out and mingle with folks, opportunities like these shouldn't be ignored. While we may be convinced that we as Ph.D. students are the only ones interested in our papers and dissertations, this is not the case. In Computer Science, for instance, local tech organizations like <a href="http://trilug.org">TriLUG</a>, <a href="http://sites.ieee.org/encs">the local IEEE Section</a>, and <a href="http://ncocra.org">Amateur Radio clubs</a> provide venues for us as researchers to share our work with audiences full of interested folks! It's important to remember that academics have a social responsibility to make the career of research a respectable one, and the only reason we have the stereotype of being absent-minded hermits disconnected from the world is because we have given society an opportunity to believe that's the case.
