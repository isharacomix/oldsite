So, I've been streaming just about every night since the month started using my
[new setup][], save for the nights when club meetings stretch past 10 PM. I can
safely say that even though I've learned how to fix the streaming problems with
Twitch.tv, I don't particularly want to.

One of my biggest problems with streaming to Twitch is that I feel like I have
to fill the silence with something, but I really do not care much for the sound
of my voice. Before every Twitch stream, I spent nearly an hour speaking into
my microphone and listening to my voice so that I would hate it less, but it
was mostly just a way of pysching myself up. With the terminal setup, I'm able
to narrate my video in the way that I find most comfortable - text. I've always
been more at home typing than speaking, since I have a tendency to trip over my
words and become essentially unintelligible. Being able to silence the stream,
and stream using an extremely low bandwidth technology makes me very happy.

Furthermore, I don't have to form an allegiance with either Twitch or Youtube
to host my videos, since they're all living right here in my blog. Now, that in
itself is a bit of a double-edged sword. There are two schools of thought in the
world of web. One is *"if you build it they will come"*. This is not necessarily
true for most people. The other is *"go where the people are"*. My blog got a
lot more traffic when it was on wordpress than it does now since I'm no longer
listed in RSS feeds or in "you might also like" lists. I'm off to sink or swim
on my own. Since I'm not using Twitch anymore, I don't show up in the /r/gamedev
or [Devstreams.tv][] lists when I'm live. I have to depend on my own social
networking skills.

The one exception is Twitter. I also joined Twitter because that was where the
people are, and was rewarded for it. I tried [identi.ca][], but they recently
updated their software preventing me from mirroring my Twitter posts, ultimately
making me want to stop using it. As nice as technology like [pump.io][] and
[Tent][] are, the protocols don't mean much if nobody is using them. While I've
written in the [past][] about the possibilities about building a decentralized
network powered by people playing open source games, social media is one part
identity and one part performance art, entirely driven by the need to drum up
publicity. I can't reach out to interested parties by posting things on my
Tent server. I *can* by pushing to Twitter. I don't want the only thing I have
in common with people in my social network to be the fact that we're on the
same social network.

However, when it comes to my streaming, I have one thing going for me: I'm not
streaming gameplay, I'm streaming game dev. Game dev isn't prioritized on Twitch
unless you happen to be making one of the top 10 expected games of 2013. The
autonomy I gain from not attempting to use Twitch and using my own streaming
platform instead is worth more to me than the perceived views I might get from
people who randomly find me on the stream. The fact of the matter is that I need
to be a better marketer for myself rather than riding on the coattails of the
services I use. This goes beyond making games, it bleeds into my research and
teaching as well. I don't keep much to myself, especially not the things that
people think are interesting or useful. This is why I'm streaming and recording
my game development. I think that's worth something.

I'll be streaming at 10 PM every night I'm able to. I hope you'll check it out!
