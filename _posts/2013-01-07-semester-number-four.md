Classes start this week. In fact, a lot of classes start this week. The class I teach, the classes I'm taking, and three of the five MOOCs that I've signed up for. The first few weeks of January are always a stressful and overwhelming time while I try to get the wheels spinning again. However, nothing has gotten me in gear quite like getting the "welcome" e-mails from my new professors, both at home and abroad.

I've got a lot to be excited about this semester. I'll be stretching my network wider than ever by taking two classes with the College of Education at NC State and one with the Ph.D. Lab at Duke University. My network has definitely been growing thanks to my involvement in one-off meetings at humanities conferences and the Twitterverse, but these courses will give me the chance to build some sustained interactions with colleagues who may be outside my department, yet more closely aligned with my interests than any Computer Scientists I know. For me, it's always been my colleagues who keep me inspired. I feed off of their enthusiasm and never hesitate to share my ideas, something that I've had going for me since starting this whole Ph.D. thing.

I've been going over the reading lists and syllabi for these new courses, and they look like they'll really be everything that I've hoped for. When it comes to non-Computer Science courses, there is a substantially greater reading load than anything I've ever been subjected to in any course I've taken... Graduate or otherwise. That being said, I've done plenty of reading over the Fall semester trying to pull together literature reviews for papers and proposals, meaning that I'm no stranger to idea of reading. In fact, I think I'd rather answer open-ended discussion questions and write papers than solve another reinforcement learning problem.

If you're wondering what makes this semester's classes so different from previous terms, it's that this time, I've got a plan. In the past, I've treated classes as interesting diversions on the way to my Ph.D. They've never really distracted me from my research, but they've never been chosen intentionally for the purposes of directing my research either. This semester, all of the classes I've registered for are electives chosen intentionally for the role that I expect them to play in my research plans. Whether they're MOOCs or residential courses, whether they're on-line or in-person, I <em>chose</em> to take these courses and I intend to make them work for me. Even for the lab I'm teaching, I know exactly what to expect this time.

Best of all, this is the semester that I'll be awarded my "en route" M.Sc. in Computer Science. I'm looking forward to donning the black gown and hood this May. It doesn't feel like it was that long ago that I walked across the stage as an Undergraduate... time certainly has flown. The closer you are to a milestone, the harder you're willing to push to get there. Graduation is just over the horizon.
