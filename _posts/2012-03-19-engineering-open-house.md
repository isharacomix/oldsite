So this past Saturday was the College of Engineering's <a href="http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/openhouse/">Open House</a>, where we got to meet all of the fresh new high school students who were going around and checking out colleges. It's essentially an undergraduate affair, so I was a bit out of place talking about research and doctoral degrees and whatnot, but being someone who had also gotten his undergraduate degree from NC State, I was able to talk about things relevant to the interests of our guests.

My job was to represent our Cyber Defense Lab, a research lab within our department primarily composed of graduate students, but it gave me a great opportunity to explain to the guests that NC State is a research institution, and all of our faculty are engaged in cutting-edge research in Computer Science. Even though most folks coming to the event were just concerned with the classwork and entry requirements for the university, I was trying to sell that even undergrads are offered the chance to get involved in research, which is a great way to set yourself apart from the rest of the pack! Even if it's not in security, or even in computer science, there are opportunities to go beyond the books and start learning about the state-of-the-art through research.

... and I probably had my hopes too high. While there were a few students who seemed to be interested in the research we were doing, perhaps I was going a bit above what they were thinking about at the moment. Kind of like the MATHCOUNTS competition, I think you have to be exposed to a year or two of college-level work to really see the value of research opportunities. Until then, you just see college as a bunch of prerequisites and introductory classes. Once you get out of Java and start learning <em>Computer Science</em>, it's easier to start thinking outside of the box. Even if the students didn't see the value there, I'm hoping the parents I spoke with did.

Speaking of the audience, it's a shame the students aren't as excited about visiting the University as I am about welcoming them there. At last year's open house, I really had a chance to talk with some motivated future students. This year's crowd seemed to either be apathetic or left speechless by our crazy Ph.D.-level presentations. Unfortunately, our group was tossed in the back of the hallway without much visibility, so I didn't get a chance to meet and socialize as much as I would have liked. I think I'm the kind of charismatic student you want at the front of the building, greeting folks and telling them how much I love this place.

I did get a chance to hang out with the fine folks from the Undergraduate Advising offices while setting things up. It feels good to have people counting on you - especially when you can actually live up to their expectations! Maybe my passion for research and teaching will shine through better tomorrow at the <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/research/symposium.html">Graduate Research Symposium</a>.
