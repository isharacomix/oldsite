title: Happy Birthday Cupcakes!
---

I baked some cupcakes for a friend of mine today, and as we know, I tend to prefer stovetop cooking to baking. Too much precision is required with baking - you have to get everything right during the preparation, and then wait 25-30 minutes for whatever you put together to come out of the oven. Unlike cooking, where you're free to tweak and nudge your recipe while it's hot, baking is more of a pass/fail kind of deal. 

For these cupcakes, I actually tried to make them vegan-style... not really because I'm of the vegan persuasion, but because A.) my friend is partially so, and B.) I hate buying eggs because I can never use them all up. Being diametrically opposed to purchasing eggs poses an issue for me when I <i>am</i> in the mood for baking, so I try to get away with not using them when I can (hence, applesauce-based cookies). In addition to going egg-free, I also used almond milk instead of regular cow milk, since I've been looking for an excuse to try it out.

When I bake things, they become very, very sweet, and this particular batch of cupcakes was no exception. Of course, the cupcakes turned out all right, just a bit squishier than I usually like them. The ginger gave them a very unique taste, and I kind of wish I would have put some cinnamon in them as well. The flavor was very strong - normally, I find vanilla cupcakes to be very subdued, but these weren't. I'm not sure if it was the vinegar or the almond milk/extract. Either way, it was a unique experience.

I kind of broke the vegan rules when it came to the frosting - I just used some frosting from the grocery store, and it probably had eggs in it. Frosting is difficult without one of those nice frosting tubes that lets you squeeze directly on top of the cupcakes. Using a spatula to distribute the frosting is a messy endeavor. Either way, even when you prefer your cupcakes without frosting, it's a violation of the rules of cupcakes to deliver them naked. I won't stand for that.

When making cupcakes for a friend, a nice way to score some extra style points is to ask your grocery store's baker for an empty cupcake container. If you're just getting one or two, they'll usually just give it to you. You never know unless you ask, and it does provide a nice touch. Just don't go crazy when you're driving to deliver them or there'll be frosting all over the inside of the container. If you can get them there in one piece, you give the whole package a professional flair.
