It's been a fun week in San Diego, but all good things must come to an end.

I got to meet a very interesting cohort of professionals here. There were industry and government system administrators, University admins who tried their hands at teaching, and even administrators who manage professional development and outreach programs for the program. Even if I was in a minority being an academic in this populaton, I still think I was able to make the most of the event by flaunting my unusual background in order to drive conversations in the direction that I wanted them to go that would ensure the greatest mutual benefit.

At NC State, our Computer Science program is extremely biased towards a "developer" culture. While a few of the classes, namely the networking classes, may develop the skills needed for a system administrator, very few courses can really be considered courses in system administration. In a way, this was echoed through many of the discussions I had with folks here at LISA, so I'm glad I got to get even a glimpse into the attitudes of the practioners here. One group that I'll definitely keep in mind is <a href="https://lopsa.org/">LOPSA</a>, a group dedicated to training and advocacy of the profession of system administration. System administrators are the engineers behind the dirty side of computing, where systems fail and assumptions break down. They are the professionals responsible for making sure that the things we take for granted "just work".

I don't have much business being at a technical conference. I'm not a system administrator. I'm not a developer. There are definitely people who surpass me when it comes to knowing about today's technology in both industry and in academia. I am an educator, so the one thing I can really get from these conferences is the opportunity to meet with practitioners and learn from them what <em>they</em> consider valuable so that I can use that to inform my own teaching. There isn't enough reaching across the aisle between academics and industry practicitioners, and I attend conferences to begin that conversation. Sometimes it blows up in my face and sometimes it's very rewarding. Someone has to be first, and it might as well be me.

Now that LISA is over, it's time for me to catch up on sending LinkedIn invitations to the folks I met, review my Tweets and the Tweets of the other attendees, and follow up with the folks who indicated some interest in collaborating with me in my educational research. I also need to get my paperwork in order back at NC State before everyone goes home for Christmas - I was re-appointed as a Teaching Assistant for Software Engineering again next semester, which will give me an opportunity to take advantage of the lessons learned this Fall and really have the chance to do the class right.

I'll be a different person in the Spring. Now that I've raised the expectations for my studies in the eyes of my mentors, it's time for me to meet those expectations by cracking down on my research and starting down the long road to my dissertation.
