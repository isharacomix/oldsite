title: A Paper Every Day

About 3 weeks ago, I started a thing on Twitter I call [#APaperEveryDay]() to encourage myself to read more papers. It's kind of ironic that I'm writing about it after a conference-induced three day hiatus, but once again, the lack of posts to my blog is getting to me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Today I read a cool paper by Easterday and Jo about replay penalties in educational games (from ITS 2014) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APaperEveryDay?src=hash">#APaperEveryDay</a></p>&mdash; Barry Peddycord III (@isharacomix) <a href="https://twitter.com/isharacomix/statuses/479608095434608640">June 19, 2014</a></blockquote>

How it works
------------
Every day, usually when I first arrive in the lab, I pick out a paper from my reading list and write up a review in my private research notebook in the form of a stream of consciousness. After reading and compiling the notes, I then start tweeting out which paper I read and the things I learned from it, how it made my think, and whatever I thought was coolest. After reading the paper, I quickly do a google scholar search to add more papers to the reading list so that it's primed and ready for the next day.

This might seem very simple, but each aspect of this protocol is extremely intentional. First and foremost, it makes me read papers. I remember last year when I tried to intentionally keep track of my papers, I would read in irregular binges of four to six papers at a time. Not only did this result in sub-par retention of the content of the papers, I ended up barely reading more than 30 papers over the course of four months. Even with the break in #APaperEveryDay, I've read nearly 15 papers up until now, and if I manage to keep it going, I'll beat that record in less than a month.

In particular, reading the paper first thing in the morning gets my mind thinking about research for the day head. It helps me contextualize what I'm going to do for the rest of the day and fills my mind with research questions and hypotheses, promoting the positive feedback loop that fills my brain with ideas for papers and studies. Without something to put me in the right mindset, I don't really end up doing anything at all, and waste days that could be spent working towards my dissertation. Limiting myself to a single paper gives me time to really let the ideas from the paper settle: I end up thinking about it a bit all day, which really gives me more familiarity with the papers I'll eventually cite one day.

The next part is the stream of consciousness. I used to have a set of questions that I answered for every paper, but I found that while those helped with *structured reviewing*, they sometimes kept me from actually reading the papers because they raised the bar to simply diving into the paper. While I'll admit that a structured review is probably a better exercise, the stream of consciousness allows me to capture how the paper fits with my current feelings about the world at *that moment*. Structured questions don't give me the flexibility I need since they not only assume that all papers are structured the same way (bad assumption when you're interdisciplinary), they also force me to come to the paper with an empty head - and that ruins the ability for me to feed the paper's content back into my own thoughts.

Then I put the paper and my views publicly on Twitter under the hashtag #APaperEveryDay. I'll talk more about this in just a bit, but for now, this was done as a way to make myself feel better about my blog inactivity, and to make my scholarship just a bit more public. I've recently stepped away from my blog and website designing in order to stop putting the cart before the horse. I get so worked up about framework and structure for presenting my work that I haven't been getting nearly enough work done. The wiki gives me a private artifact that a particular job got done, while the Twitter engagement gives me a public artifact.

Finally, there's a reason why I pick out a few papers for my next day *in advance*, and that is that I've learned that it's easier to do a task if you don't get caught thinking about it first. When I get up, I know that I have a list of papers to read and I should just pick one from it. This is a mindless task that doesn't get me wrapped up in pre-filtering or choice-weighing. I've learned that if you do the thinking up front and leave yourself with tasks, you're in a better position to get things done in your life.

The Public Engagement Part

When I started my tweeting, I managed to pull two of my fellow graduate students at NC State into the habit of doing #APaperEveryDay, and this was tremendously rewarding. In a way, we are kind of like a disjoint virtual reading group. This is very motivating since now I know that I've got people keeping an eye on me, and I can keep an eye on my colleagues as well. It would be really cool if this hashtag got a bit more popularity, since it would not just mean that I started a trend, it would get more public discussion about scholarship!

I've also been engaged by some of my non-academic colleagues thanks to this very public kind of taking notes in a way that is just as rich (but perhaps less overwhelming) than the conference live-blogging I used to do. In response to Calvin above, #APaperEveryDay is my personal attempt at doing academic scholarship in public in a very different way. When we talk about the open access of papers, just making them freely available is not enough, since much of the prerequisite knowledge is still locked away, and the audience that papers are written towards makes the papers inpenetrable to the general public. I would love to add a section to my blog where I write "plain english" versions of all of my papers so that my work becomes accessible to the public without necessarily harming my ability to get my publication points.

Overall
-------
I don't like how I've not been writing in my blog, since it means that I'm **no longer thinking about the presentation of my work**. While I mentioned before that I don't want to put the cart before the horse, I believe that keeping presentation in mind helps contextualize the research around public engagement in the first place. Doing #APaperEveryDay is a great compromise, at least for now, because it helps me do the work I already need to do, publicly. After a longer period of running this hashtag, I'd love to explore this in more detail.
