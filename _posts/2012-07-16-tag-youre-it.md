I try to make it a point to read at least research one paper every night. Granted, this turns out to be a more ambitious goal than it sounds, because otherwise, I would have already read over 300 papers since starting my Ph.D. Of course, when I say <em>read a paper</em>, this isn't like the light reading that I do when perusing my favorite blogs. When I <em>read a paper</em>, it means that I usually have a highlighter in hand and my trusty <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> window on the screen so that I can mark key points on the physical copy while writing a summary/reflection to be preserved on my computer indefinitely. Recently though, I've been playing with some different styles of keeping notes on the things I read.

One thing that bugs me is that when I force myself to write a "big reflective summary" of the papers I read, I find myself not evenly distributing my attention to what I'm writing. Some of the summaries are very detailed, contain insightful content, and are even applicable to future papers and grant proposals! But other times, especially when I'm trying to get multiple papers read for the purpose of a literature review, I find myself slowly paraphrasing the paper in Zotero while I read it, getting a very superficial perspective on what the paper is really trying to address.

So I looked back at my Zotero folder and my stack of papers and asked myself "why do we read papers?"

The answer is obvious: for citations.

Despite the politically correct things we would like to say about staying on top of the current research or following the work of our esteemed colleagues, when you cut through the fat, the reason why we build these collections of papers that we've read is so that when we write a paper or a proposal, we have a collection of papers that were are familiar with that we can cite to bolster our own claims. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I always read a paper from start to finish. I never cite a paper I haven't read, which may impose more work on me, but at least it means I can be knowledgeable about what I'm citing. So in Zotero, I tag papers with appropriate keywords, connect them to papers that they cite or are related to, and (what I consider most important) I give every paper at least a one-page summary.

But are my priorities straight? After all, perhaps the summary is not the most important part. While it's good to refresh my memory of the paper with my own words, if my own words are just a superficial rephrasing of the paper, do I really get anything that I wouldn't have already gotten from reading the paper a second time? Let's re-evaluate the question: why do we read papers, and how does keeping a digital portfolio augment this goal?

A digital portfolio allows us to search for papers by entering keywords and following links to and from related works.

When we have this goal in mind, it makes this summary appear much less important than I make it out to be. In fact, the most important aspect turns out to be the one I spend the least time on - tagging. It turns out that I rely on including rich enough verbiage in my summaries so that when I search for a term, I will get a list of papers based on matching terms in these summaries. But I don't write these summaries for machines, right?

So here's my idea: I want to tag articles with keywords, and I want to bring attention to poignant quotes from the article as well as my own insights and criticisms. I want to connect my thoughts across multiple papers, linking them with overarching tags. Above all, when looking through my portfolio, I want to see <em>connections</em> that are <em>relevant</em>.

What does this remind you of? It reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_maps">concept maps</a>. It reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a>. I shouldn't be writing an entire dissertation on every paper I read. It's too much effort with too little payoff. All I need is a little blurb - no bigger than a sticky note - that I can stick to a single paper or to a cluster of papers.

I need to change the way I approach my reading and note-taking. My notes need to be about quality over quantity, but my fat notebook and verbose summaries betray this opinion to the point of fostering a sense of faux-productivity, which is worse than procrastination.
