For those of you who haven't noticed, I'm now participating in assisting Google with tracking your behavior on my website. If you scroll all the way to the bottom and check out the right corner, you'll see a big <b>+1</b> button along with a link to my Google+ profile. So why would I do this? I'm no friend of Google's. Why would I do something so heinous?

Well, Google is trying to rework their search engine so that when you look for information, you get... well... information. As part of their efforts to stomp out spam blogs, they have made it possible to tag your posts with the "author" meta tag, telling Google and other search engines who is responsible for the content. They do this with their "identity service", Google+, by having reciprocal links between the G+ profile page and the author page on blogs and websites, making it possible to identify who has produced the content that has been found, even making your avatar appear under the search results so you can find more content by that person. It's pretty fly.

So I did all the linking following some instructions from <a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/google-publisher-code-with-badge-and-1-button?replies=12">the Wordpress forums</a> and voila, I have a +1 button and link to my profile page. So why doesn't my picture show up in search results? Huh?

Well, as it turns out, apparently only big-name authors are getting this privilege to start off with. And there's also some iffiness about not using a "real photo" for your profile picture (which I refuse to comply with). But that being said, this is really a step in the right direction. Even if - functionally - it just creates a shallow reason to push Google+, it also opens search engines to finding real content, not garbage. After all, looking for my name, "Barry Peddycord", doesn't even bring up my blog on the first page of results! What does it bring up? Social networking sites. How does that even happen? I never link to my Fa--... that page. So why is it up top? Plus, there's that stupid ancestry website stuff. That doesn't belong in search results for me. I feel like this will begin to put more weight towards user-generated material, really taking advantage of the "everyone's a publisher" nature of Web 2.0.

As we begin to take ownership of our content, discerning value from noise will become easier and more rewarding. In addition to further connecting us to information, it will help connect us as people. I look forward to seeing what new things are done with this kind of technology. Additionally, I'd love to see Google properly process the Creative Commons license links as well, so that it's easier to find legitimate content for remixing.

On a side note, if you don't want to be tracked by me and Google, install <a href="http://noscript.net">NoScript</a>, and block Google's code from running in your browser. It's trivially easy and very effective.
