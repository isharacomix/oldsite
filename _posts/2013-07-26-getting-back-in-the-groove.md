title: Getting Back in the Groove
---

EDM and AIED were some awesome conferences, but were still no match for the
overwhelming force of the **post-conference slump**. The post-conference slump
is the state of complete and utter exhaustion after doing your best to maintain
multiple days of first impressions in a row, delivering dozens of elevator
pitches of your own research, and seeing awesome presentation after awesome
presentation, and trying to keep up with the state of the research as it advanced
while you were off goofing around at your home institution all year.

The slump is a dangerous place to be, since you definitely didn't get any work
done while you were out of town, and therefore have to work twice as hard to get
back up to your previous level of productivity. Coming home to a massive TODO
list of papers to read, test questions to write, and github repositories to
maintain can be a serious blow to your self-confidence, which I don't need after
seeing so many smart people at a conference that I could never compete with in
a million years. The post-conference slump is a negative feedback loop that
creates a black hole in your spirit and stops you from working on projects that
[desperately need your attention](http://8bitmooc.org) if they're going to go
live in September on schedule.

When it comes to tackling a massive TODO list, tackling it like a bull doesn't
work for me. Instead, I pick off low-hanging fruit with surgical precision
from a distance, whittling away at its defenses so that I don't get clobbered
when I mount a full-on assault. I've started using Github for everything in my
life these days, with a TODO list maintained in an issue tracker, but in order
to settle my needs in the physical world, I've repurposed my research journal
where each day I enumerate the things I want to get done, take notes throughout
the day recording what I do, and then end each day by listing my accomplishments.

I like this idea since it allows me to actually use my research journal again,
which I haven't used since April, and it also encourages reflection and planning
so that I keep myself in gear. I put things on the issue tracker in Github so I
don't lose them, and I put things in the notebook to keep them fresh in my mind.
I find it helps to write things down over and over again, making the journal more
effective than sticky notes - even if it just happens to be a novelty effect.
Once you complete a task, you get a boost of energy that makes it easier to move
on to the next, and that is a truly wonderful feeling.

In addition to the notebook, the other thing that keeps me productive is
talking about research with my friends and colleagues. As I keep telling myself,
the reason I love grad school and academia are the people. By interacting
with mentors and peers, discussing past and future research projects, I stay
motivated to keep my own work going. I'm looking forward to finally
getting back on track with #8bitmooc tomorrow, which has been a long time
coming!

Sometimes things get rough, and sometimes I feel like I can't get out of the
holes I dig for myself, but it's moments like these - the accomplishments -
that make it all worth it. :)
