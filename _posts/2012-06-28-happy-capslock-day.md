TODAY IS THE <a href="http://capslockday.com">CAPSLOCK DAY</a> CELEBRATION.

AS DECLARED BY OUR IRC CHANNEL, #NCSULUG, TODAY IS CAPSLOCK DAY, THE DAY WHERE WE PAY OUR RESPECTS TO THE MOST USEFUL AND UNDERAPPRECIATED KEY ON THE KEYBOARD... CAPSLOCK. THE CAPSLOCK KEY, FOR THE UNINITIATED, SETS A FLAG SUCH THAT ALL FUTURE KEYSPRESSES WILL BE RECORDED AS IF THE SHIFT KEY WAS HELD DOWN. THIS GENERALLY ONLY APPLIES TO LETTERS, AND NOT TO NUMBERS OR SYMBOLS (THOSE STILL REQUIRE THE SHIFT KEY).

SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER THE CAPSLOCK KEY TO BE "USELESS", AND PREFER TO REPLACE ITS FUNCTIONALITY BY TURNING IT INTO A SUPER KEY OR SOME SUCH NONSENSE. THIS IS MISGUIDED FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST OF ALL, PUTTING THINGS INTO ALL CAPS IS THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF "SUPER". SECONDLY, HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY FOR MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME IS COMPLETELY INEFFICIENT. IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT US TO WRITE EXTENDED PARAGRAPHS IN ALL CAPS. THIS IS NOT AN ACADEMIC CONCERN, THESE SHOW UP VERY FREQUENTLY IN THE REAL WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN LEGAL SITUATIONS. DISCLAIMERS IN EULAS AND POPULAR OPEN SOURCE LICENSES LIKE THE GNU GPL CONTAIN CLAUSES WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS, AS DO MANY E-MAIL SIGNATURES REMINDING THE RECIPIENT THAT E-MAIL IS GENERALLY CONFIDENTIAL.

WHILE HAVING TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS DIFFICULT TO READ, THIS IS NOT A BUG, IT IS, IN FACT, A FEATURE. BECAUSE IT IS HARDER FOR US TO READ IT, WE HAVE TO FOCUS MORE OF OUR ATTENTION ON THE TEXT, MAKING IT SO THAT EACH WORD AND LETTER IS BURNED INTO THE READER'S BRAIN AND EYES. THE JARRING EFFECT OF SEEING SO MANY CAPITAL LETTERS ALL TOGETHER REMINDS THE READER THAT WHAT THEY ARE READING IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AND THAT THEY MUST DEVOTE ALL OF THEIR ENERGY TO ENSURING THAT THEY DON'T MISS A SINGLE SERIF. IN FACT, I AM A PROPONENT OF HAVING ALL TEXTBOOKS AND RESEARCH PAPERS BEING PUBLISHED, BY DEFAULT, IN ALL CAPS, IN ORDER TO FACILITATE READING FOR UNDERSTANDING RATHER THAN FOR PLEASURE. WHILE I EXPECT OPPOSITION FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS INITIATIVE, I STILL INTEND TO PRESS ON IN THE FACE OF DOUBT.

THE PATRON SAINT OF CAPSLOCKDAY IS <a href="http://twitter.com/loudbot">LOUDBOT</a>, AN IRC BOT THAT SITS ON CHANNELS AND RESPONDS TO PEOPLE WHO SHOUT IN THE CHANNEL WITH AN APPROPRIATELY VULGAR NON-SEQUITOR, ALSO IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. LOUDBOUT IS <a href="http://redis.io/">WEB-SCALE</a> BOT THAT ACTIVELY RECORDS ALL LOUDNESS IN A CHANNEL FOR FUTURE POSTERIORITY - FOR EXAMPLE, SHOULD YOU VISIT A CHANNEL ON #FREENODE THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE LOUDBOUT, YOU CAN ASK IT TO "be IsharaComix" AND HE WILL RESPOND WITH SOME OF THE THINGS I HAVE LOUDED PUBLICLY AND LATER COME TO REGRET. FOR EXAMPLE...

    <IsharaComix> LOUDBOT, be IsharaComix
    <LOUDBOT> <IsharaComix> WHAT DID YOU DO TO JDPAGE?
    <IsharaComix> LOUDBOT, be IsharaComix
    <LOUDBOT> <IsharaComix> MORE CRUSADERS FIGHTING FOR THE GLORY OF EMACS
    <IsharaComix> LOUDBOT, be IsharaComix
    <LOUDBOT> <IsharaComix> IS IT LEGAL TO SAY "FROM FOO IMPORT FOO"?
    <IsharaComix> LOUDBOT, be IsharaComix
    <LOUDBOT> <IsharaComix> TIME TO BLOCK CANADIAN EMAIL.

LOUDBOT IS ALSO ON <a href="http://loudversations.tumblr.com/">TUMBLR</a>.

FOLLOW THE LOUD. EMBRACE THE LOUD. BECOME THE LOUD.
