Happy New Year! Things sure look different around here, don't they? As you can
well see, I have completely overhauled my entire website! We're still running
happily on Github Pages, but just as much has changed behind the scenes as in
your face!

Since I started my idea of streaming back on Twitch in October, I've been
thinking a lot about the kind of stuff I do on this website. I write a lot,
mostly as a sort of public-private journal to talk about how I look at things
in life, technology, and the academy, which I personally find very helpful
and therapeutic, but perhaps not the most useful for my readers. Since leaving
Wordpress, my readership has dropped substantially. This doesn't really bother
me, since I don't care as much about getting a new audience as much as I care
about providing content that is suitable or has value for *any* audience.

I mean, since I started using Twitter in Grad School, that's been the main way
that I communicate with the world. My blog is a quiet place for me to collect
my thoughts, but sometimes I wish that the articles on my blog were more
useful for readers. Things that people would look up when they needed help on
a particular issue... not "just another Ph.D. student perspective". As much as
I love tech, it's not something I write about since I'm not useful when it
comes to unsolicited advice (though I personally think I answer questions very
well!).

So when I started streaming, I was very happy that I found a new way to build
on my desire to build creative artifacts (games), share them publicly, and
hopefully teach someone something. My blog posts were originally supposed to
fit these three elements, but I feel like they may have been the wrong
solution. That doesn't mean that livestreams of game development are *right*,
but it's a step in a new direction.

The new blog design was made after careful consideration of how I interact
with the world. A long time ago, I made [a list][] media websites I had
accounts on. Unfortunately, that list has grown, but this time, I was thinking
about the ones I'm on that I actively use in order to handle my brand.

 * My blog for my CV and hub
 * Github for sourcecode
 * Twitter for interactions

Since these were the key ways I interact, I decided to turn my blog into a
hub that brings all of these elements together. Here's what we came up with:

First and foremost, the center of the blog is a terminal, indicating that what
I love is technology. It has a standard greeting for anyone who arrives, but
has a special power: it uses the amazing project [TTYcast][] on the backend in
order to support livestreaming the contents of my terminal directly to the
front page of my website! Essentially, it's a terminal version of Twitch,
built entirely on open source software! Furthermore, I can even save
[replays][] of the streams for future use! How amazing is that!?

On the two sidebars, I feature my Twitter blog and my "actual" blog, each
subdued so that they don't distract from the main action of the livestream,
but also inviting to explore. I feature the dates of each blog post along
with the number of comments, and the Twitter widget enables someone to reach
out to me directly from the front page (maybe even while I'm streaming!).

To add even more interactivity, clicking the "chat" button on my home page
reveals another terminal, one that the user can utilize to join my blog's
IRC channel! This enables another means of interaction during streaming or
blogging. Since the software is all open source, anyone can clone my site and
set it up themselves! Terminal livestreaming for the masses, built on already
available technology.

Originally I was hosting the streaming from my desktop at home, but was
encouraged to invest in a VPS by the security/bandwidth problems that come
with running a "home server". Seeing a New Year's Twitter promo from
[DigitalOcean][], worth $10, I decided to give them a shot, and I'm already
thrilled to have my own virtual server that I can play with. Considering it's
only $5 a month, I'm more than happy to pay that and get a server I can use
to host any number of applications.

All in all, this is an experiment. I don't imagine this will make me rich or
popular, but I was very happy that I challenged myself to learn something new
and build something interesting. It feels good to also have set up a policy
of streaming game development for a couple of hours every night. It keeps me
motivated and energized, which I think is a good way to kick off a new year.
