title: Year End Wrap-Up
---
Since I've turned in my final paper and finished all of my grading, all of my
responsibilities for 2013 have come to an end! I've still got a few more meetings
left on the calendar, but those don't actually count - the year is over and I
haven't blogged since last Sunday.

You know, when you look at the year by the numbers, things look really good. I
managed to write three conference papers, one journal paper, and a book chapter
this year. I attended a bunch of conferences and did a bunch of presentations.
I managed to lead two student groups who were slowly dwindling in numbers back
on the path to sustainability. I taught all year. What's more, I managed to turn
a class project this semester into what will turn into at least a year-long
research agenda with a MOOC project on the plate for next Spring ready to go.
All of that should have me pretty pleased with myself.

I don't know if it's just the fatigue finally catching up with me after pushing
myself as hard as I did this semester or what, but I still feel like I could have
done better. Not in terms of my output, but in terms of my *attitude*. I'm very
unhappy with the way I look at how I spend my time. I'm way too lethargic, don't
have nearly enough initiative, and am just disappointed with how completely
unorganized I am. I don't keep the papers I read organized, my understanding of
the research field I'm in is spotty and all over the place, and I still haven't
started my dissertation proposal. I also don't think I fully appreciate how
completely taxing meetings are, since I've been having them essentially non-stop
all month, and I can see how this stops anything from getting done.

To be fair, I should give myself credit for the things that have made me happy:
and number one was streamlining my entire workflow from research to blogging to
everything onto my [Github](http://github.com/isharacomix) account. I've even
managed to set up a Github-based system for
[presentations](http://github.com/isharacomix/presentations), which I thought
was super-cool!

Believing that it's just going to get easier doesn't work. Just because I won't
be teaching a year from now doesn't mean the responsibilities will lighten up.
If it's not teaching, it's something else, like trying to write a grant or look
for a job. Trying to bank my energy on a future moment of reprieve that may or
may not ever come is a bad idea.

So a few pre-New Year's resolutions:

 * More papers are gonna get read. I'm going to totally reboot my research
   repository on Github and keep a more useful database of what I need to know
   for the work I do. There are a lot of good papers out there and I need to be
   able to cite them.
 * Program more. Whether it's games or tools or open source projects, programming
   may be a taxing experience, but I get such a rush of positive energy whenever
   I program that there's no reason I shouldn't do it more often. I might keep up
   the livestreaming stuff, or I might not, but I should do more programming.
 * Write on the blog more regularly.
 * Carve out time for leisure. If I have to be intentional about taking my time
   off, then so be it. I'm sure I've written about this before, but whenever I
   end up goofing off without deciding to goof off in advance, I feel like I'm
   cheating myself out of something. As long as it's something I do because I
   want to do it, that's good. But the lethargy has to come to an end sometime.
