on Twitter these past week, the topic of privilege has been on my mind lately.
Yes, I'm a white, straight, cis male with a Master's degree, but that's not the
privilege I specifically want to talk about today (despite being a very interesting
topic and related to the following). Instead, I want focus on my *academic* or
*disciplinary* privilege.

Quantitative fields like chemistry, physics, and Computer Science enjoy an
interesting a privileged position relative to other academic disciplines.
After all, since they are "objective", they aren't bogged down by problems like
the unrepeatability of "interviews" and "surveys". They are "free" of those
"uncontrollable human factors". David Gillborn, a critical race theorist from
the University of Birmingham, beautifully deconstructs the "objectivity" of
quantitative methods in his 2010 paper,
[the Colour of Numbers](http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/1638/), in the form of a
narrative between a graduate student and his professor.

Reconciling the paradigms of inquiry between the disciplines that I'm interested
in has been a difficult experience. In computer science, even when it's not
relevant to the research, I've seen committee members *demand* quantitative
results and refuse to approve the work until something to that effect is
shoehorned in. On the same token, when I bring up data mining and numbers in the
company of humanities scholars, I often feel an air of disapproval wash over me.
In communities of scholarship, we have well-entrenched beliefs in what approaches
to discovering truth are valid, and we eschew the unfamiliar. Participating in
the digital humanities and meeting people who research the intersections of
technology and everything else has encouraged me to be more open-minded in how
I assess others' forms of inquiry, such as Gillborn's CRT Chronicle, and instead
of questioning the approach, look at the assumptions that the approaches make
and evaluate their appropriateness for the scholarship at hand.

However, my home discipline's cultures and attitudes cut deeper than methods of
inquiry. As a Computer Scientist, I have particular security in my ability to
pursue grants and jobs, and thanks to my numerous connections, this security
extends beyond the academy. Computer Scientists don't have to teach when their
research money can cover their salary. For us, teaching is either a *distraction*
(at worst) or a *curious diversion* (at best) from our "real job", which is doing
research. While the best professors take advantage of teaching in order to hunt
down and recruit potential grad students (which is why I love my advisors),
the recent trend to hire faculty or employing grad students specifically for
teaching lower-level classes shows how entrenched the idea that teaching is a
"service", but not what our professors want to do the bulk of their time doing.
The same basic idea comes from doing "interdisciplinary" research when you look
at it through the lens of our culture. If I tease out all of the cruft of my
personal interests and get to the heart of why what I'm doing is possible, it
comes down to one succint, condescending sentence:

    I can afford to "dabble" in the humanities because I'm a "computer
    scientist" and my "real job" will keep me secure even if this
    doesn't work out.

As a programmer, I don't human very well, so I genuinely believe that interacting
with humanities scholars can help provide context for my research (since
educational research is necessarily interdisciplinary). I don't see it as dabbling.
But facing this reality is a necessary step in recognizing how my field *enables*
me to do the research I'm doing. There is essentially no threat to my ability to
graduate and get a job by interacting with other fields, while collaboration from
the other side, the so-called "digital humanities", doesn't have the same luxury.
The publishing model, the tenure model, and even respect within the field is at
risk after "selling out" and *acknowledging beliefs that some happen to hold that
objective scientific research is in some way superior to the work they are doing.*

The reason why I tell people that my interests fall under Computer Science
education with respect to non-majors is because I've met these digital humanities
scholars. They are the most fascinating people because unlike me and other
students who went into computer science as undergraduates, they know what they
want from technology and *use that to motivate their learning*. These aren't the
people we have to convince to pay attention, they only lack the content and
cultural knowledge, and that *can* be taught. I love my undergraduates to pieces,
but many of them have already worked in the industry, and they're just going
through the motions of a class that's moving too slow for them.

This likely won't be the last time I visit this topic. The pushes for "evidence
based teaching" and "objective measures of learning" rub me the wrong way
because they oversimplify the situational aspects of learning. Despite studying
educational data mining, I don't believe we can make end-all be-all models of
students. I *do* believe that using mixed-methods approaches, taking computational
models and then bringing in the qualitative analysis to discuss their composition,
will lead to wonderful insights in learning, as long as we don't simply treat
one paradigmatic approach as "the right way". Here's hoping for some interesting
follow-ups as I proceed through my program.
