The other day, colleague and social media pro <a href="https://twitter.com/adelinekoh">Adeline Koh</a> posted a link on Twitter to an interesting article discussing what the author refers to as <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-irl-fetish/">"The IRL Fetish"</a>. He writes about this nostalgic, romantic obsession that we have for the "real world", rebelling against this digital, hyperconnected reality that has engulfed our society in recent years. The first thought that went through my mind was the anime series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain"><em>Serial Experiments Lain</em></a> (watch it, it rocks), but it wasn't long before my mind was full of ideas, and I basically had an out-of-body experience as I watched myself add sticky notes to my "idea wall" so that I would have fodder for some future blog entries.

I always find it funny when I catch myself doing something silly when I should know better. I first noticed these logical inconsistencies when I signed up for my very first Distance Ed class at NC State for next Spring. I noticed it was an online class, and I instinctively told myself that I would wait for a semester when it would be offered in person - which seems extremely out of character if you've ever shared more than three sentences with me. As passionate as I am about online education and making it better, it's laughably quaint that I would allow such an old, misinformed prejudice to rear its ugly head when I've been doing enough research to know better by now. Not only did I sign up for it, but I felt like I was really sticking it to the old me by doing so. I was defiant.

I got that same feeling while heading over to the idea wall, and it made me feel less defiant and more uncomfortable. Despite being very connected with technology (I am a Computer Scientist, after all), I still find myself clinging to very primitive ways of doing things, like sticking sticky notes all over my room. It was only recently that I finally stopped printing out journal articles and started reading them in <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>. When I got my Nexus, I started using my Google calendar like it was second nature! It's a pain when you can only access your calendar on your computer, but when it was on a mobile device, it suddenly fit into my workflow in a way in which it did not fit before. But my migration to computers, even after all these years, has been a very slow process.

I generally argue to myself that putting my stuff on the machine is setting myself up to lose it, which may seem a little strange... I mean, if it's on the computer, I can just copy and copy and put it in the cloud and never lose my data again! Sounds like a dream come true to someone terrified of losing their calendar or their contacts or their research notes. But the problem with the cloud is that I'm putting myself at the mercy of a company which most certainly does not have my best interests at heart. I don't store my photos on Google or Facebook or Twitter not because I'm afraid of sharing them, but because I feel as though relying on storage given to me by the grace of a mega-corporation seems like a fool's bargain. Free Software I understand. Free services, not so much. In most cases, apps and programs designed to make our lives easier are not programs living residentially on our computers, but off on a server that could vanish off the face of the Earth overnight.

I was reluctant to put my presentations on Prezi because I didn't want to put myself at their mercy. I was reluctant to draft papers on Google Docs because I didn't want to be at their mercy. Social bookmarking is tricky because what would I do if the link dies? I refuse to buy e-books because of the DRM that makes it possible for me to be locked out of the content I pay for. Heck, for a while, I was worried about getting too attached to my domain name, which I <em>ended up switching anyway</em> (that last one's kind of silly, because if domain name providers get dropped, that's a much bigger problem). The nice thing about a paper research notebook or a wall of ideas is that it's always there, whether the power's working, the Internet is working, or whatever. It makes me feel like <em>I'm in control</em>.

That's the part that fools people, isn't it?

We want to be in control, and subjecting ourselves to the "magic" of computers and technology makes us feel as though we are giving something up. We don't want to see technology become a part of society, so we create imaginary divides between "Internet friends" and "real friends". We declare there's a difference between "online classes" and "real classes". We demonize, we discriminate, there always has to be a bad guy or something to get in a moral panic about. We romanticize about "simpler" days, before everything got so "complicated". And I get it - I understand why other people have these opinions.

But I'm a Computer Scientist... aren't I?
