title: Progression in Games

I've been thinking about games lately, specifically on the idea of how progression
through a game manifests itself. These days, part of what makes games enjoyable
is the sense of progressing through it. I'm looking primarily at the single-player
aspects of games here, since in multiplayer games, part of the buy-in comes from
the metagame of competition between players, but all of that happens above the
game. Here, I'm looking at what makes people like me want to keep coming back
to a one-player game in terms of what I have to show for my playtime.

### Personal Growth
The de facto way that the time you have played a game is represented in game
terms. As you kill more monsters, find more treasure, and complete more quests,
you are rewarded with the ultimate fungible prize: experience points. An
abstraction of what you learn during your time in whatever world you're in,
getting experience, gaining levels, and acquiring new skills not only allows you
to tackle bigger and badder dangers, but lets you look at yourself and see how
far you've come. Before, those ten-foot-tall ogres gave you a run for your money,
and now you face about twenty of them going from dungeon to dungeon.

The growth in this power curve can be steep or shallow - in games like
*Final Fantasy*, you reach the game with near-legendary power, doing thousands
of damage points with every hit. In some games, the growth is much slower, often
involving picking up stronger skills or weapons rather than racking up piles
of hit points.

### Trophies
Another way that progress can be represented is in the treasure you collect as
you travel the world. From the bones of dragons to the treasure swords you get
from kings of distance lands, assuming you have a house to show them off in,
returning home lets you see the treasure you've accumulated in your time in this
world. Collecting treasure is one of my favorite ways of representing growth
since it's particularly amenable to games that use procedural generation. While
there is often a cap to how strong you can become, getting physical trinkets of
particularly difficult quests is a fun way to remember the unique events the game
has thrown at you.

Racing games like *Midnight Club* are one of my favorite genres that take
advantage of this style of growth - not all treasures have to be cosmetic, some
can be functional, and having a garage of cars that you've won as you've made
it through the game is a fun way to remember what it was like when you first
started the game.

### Environmental Influence
*Minecraft* breaks all the rules and expectations about games. There is practically
no growth, and the world is composed of self-similar blocks with some more rare
than others, but the way that progress manifests itself in games like these is
purely in the artifacts you leave behind as you build. From huts to castles,
gravel roads to superhighways, looking at the structures you've built while in
the world tells everyone how long you've been playing and what you've managed
to accomplish. *Dwarf Fortress* does this in an interesting way by allowing you
to visit (and if you dare, reclaim) the fortresses left behind by unsuccessful
playthroughs. *Animal Crossing* does this to an extent when you craft a perfect
town with the right trees, public works projects, and villagers.

This is a great way to improve replayability in sandbox games, since you can't
just keep procedurally generating newer and more exotic experiences (unless
[Starbound](http://playstarbound.com) meets its expectations). Even when the
number of resources in the world remains fixed, if you can build your own world,
that creates something that's wholly unique with a history behind it.

### Scale
In role-playing games, you're often a single person - sometimes a hero destined
to change the course of society, and sometimes a simple survivor looking to make
it big in the world. However, when you command enough authority, you soon find
yourself being respected enough by upstart young adventurers who want to make
a name for themselves as well. From fighting in wars yourself to commanding a
single team of soldiers to waging wars on multiple fronts for your entire nation, 
instead of simply fighting bigger and badder monsters, you get involved in
political struggles that stretch far beyond the life of a single adventurer.

*Civilization* and other 4X games do this to an extent. Your strength in the world
is more or less represented by its size, and as your civilization gets larger,
part of the power curve comes from trying to control it as it grows. I like strategy
games with this long-term growth curve, since the difficulty or ease of the game
comes from how well you ensure that you don't grow too slowly or spread yourself
too thin.

I just felt like writing about this since I've been thinking about it for so long.
I might do more gaming related posts in the future if I take a notion to wanting
to.
