title: Teaching is Hard
---
I just got back from **Minecon** and I have to say, I had a blast. Not only did
I get to hang out with other gamers interested in something that I liked, I also
got to meet all of the amazing parents and teachers who look at *Minecraft* as
a positive influence in their childrens' lives. Jens, the lead developer of
Minecraft, made a statement that I thought was very profound: unlike most of
the news and press around video games, all of the attention that *Minecraft*
receives is overwhelmingly positive. Parents and teachers recognize the opportunity
for games in the classroom when they see this game, and that brightens my day.
The folks at Minecon are a self-selecting crowd. These are the truest fans (and
the most dedicated parents thereof) who are willing to shell out the cash to buy
a ticket and fly down to Florida to be part of a small 7500-person get-together
around a game that breaks all the rules of what makes a game successful or
profitable.

I got to meet the folks behind [MinecraftEDU](http://minecraftedu.com), and I
have to say, I was super-impressed... enough to want to get my lab to buy it for
our outreach efforts. While I have never cared much for mods to the game, mods
like Edu, *ComputerCraft*, and the new Quantum-Computing *qCraft* have really
opened my eyes as to how much *Minecraft* can go beyond the surface. While it
wasn't an academic conference, that didn't stop me from making my general
introduction about my research, which the modders, parents, and teachers all
thought was very fascinating. I received lots of requests to follow up after
the convention, which made the entire event worth it professionally, as well as
personally.

I feel like my research has grounded to a complete halt. I haven't made any
progress on [#8bitmooc](http://8bitmooc.org) in over two months, and I still
have yet to get anything into a conference. I've blamed my mood for a while, but
after looking at how I've been spending my time, I've discovered that teaching
is one heck of a time sink. With lectures and office hours taking up half of my
Tuesdays and Thursdays, plus grading and answering questions all throughout the
week, teaching a single class is a full-time job, and I still need to get my
research done if I want to graduate!

I used to take solace in the fact that since I'm interested in educational research,
my teaching informs my research, but now I think that having the two together is
becoming somewhat of a liability. At least when my research has nothing to do with
the classroom, I'd have the benefit of being able to snap out of teacher mode
and focus on development or something. But since I'm always thinking about everything
like a teacher and like a scientist, being in that state of mind is exhausting.
It's not like I don't enjoy it - I take the good and the bad of teaching in
stride. The problem is that since I'm dedicated to getting it right, I'm too willing
to put my students' before myself, and that doesn't result in getting a Ph.D. I
just care too much.

Being a computer scientist requires me to wear a lot of different hats - I'm
a researcher studying the best ways to teach. I'm a practitioner perfecting the
craft of my own teaching. I'm an engineer when I design online class environments
and websites. Sometimes I struggle thinking about which hat I like the best, since
each one can be taken all the way in a different direction, whether that's becoming
a tenure track professor or joining up with an edtech startup. I love my field,
but does that mean taking up its tools, teaching others what I love about it, or
extending the field itself through research and study? I can't do all the things,
and even though I've always *known* that, it takes a while to accept and internalize.

Sometimes I wish I could just drop it all and dig around in *Minecraft*.
