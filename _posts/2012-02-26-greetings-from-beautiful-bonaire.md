title: Greetings from Beautiful Bonaire!

I've never traveled much in my life - I grew up and lived in the same town until I started college, and even then, Raleigh isn't exactly out of the way. But now, I've gone farther from home than I've ever been, the Caribbean island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaire">Bonaire</a> - a special municipality within the Netherlands. It's a tiny little island off the coast of Venezuela, but it's got a nice quaint feel to it.

I'm not here on a pleasure cruise, though. After all, I'm missing a week of class and pushing my midterms all over the place. No, no... I'm here to present at my very first conference, <a href="http://fc12.ifca.ai">Financial Cryptography 2012</a>. I've been travelling a bit since I started the Ph.D. Last summer, I went to my first workshop, and then in the fall, I went to a progress report session. This one, though, is an honest-to-goodness. We may be out here having a party tonight, but tomorrow, it's going to be all business.

I'm not going to mince words. My first night was kind of rough. I didn't bring any shaving supplies or toothpaste, and they didn't have it at the front desk, so I found myself heading out into town and stopping by the local mini-market. As soon as I discovered that, my pool of resources grew to at least twice the size that I started with. I picked up a few rolls of bread and some peanut butter so that I could have a low-cost, high-efficiency snack. Things are quite expensive out here, so I'm glad I could get something for myself, though I'd prefer to have a stove to cook with.

Now that the conference has more-or-less begun, I've started meeting folks and beginning the networking phase. I don't particularly care much for islands and beaches, but now that I've got the human contact I crave, I am enjoying myself much, much more. I met some great folks, and we went to a local Italian restaurant for dinner. I had a delicious pasta dinner, as well as some amazing orange champagne (my third-ever alcoholic drink... how about that...). So it's fair to say that I am indeed enjoying myself.

I would have some photos to share, but I don't have a connector cable between my computer and my camera, so we'll have to wait until I get back before I can share all the cool stuff I've been seeing out here. In the mean time, I need to practice for my presentation on Tuesday.
