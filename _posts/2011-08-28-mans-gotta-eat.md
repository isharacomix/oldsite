title: A man's gotta eat!
---

When I moved out and started living on my own, I promised myself that no matter how stressed out I was or how heavy my workload got, I would always make sure that I did the following three things:

 * Eat Healthy
 * Eat Economically
 * Eat *Something*

For the most part, I've managed to pull this off pretty well. First and foremost, I *always* have breakfast, even if its nothing special. It's usually just a bowl of sugary cereal, a glass of chocolate milk, and a little cup of fruity yogurt. Sometimes I mix it up a bit and have some toast with cream cheese or something like that, but this is a good part of the day where I get a fair dosage of fruit and dairy.

I pack quite a bit into my lunch, to keep me alive for an 8-hour day of research or studying. Since it's not worth paying the "convenience fee" for eating at the University, I make my lunch at home and bring it with me. I usually fix a sandwich with sliced turkey and some kind of cheese, along with some carrot sticks and a nice, hot bag of microwave popcorn. When I'm swamped with work, I just eat in my cubicle while running experiments or reading papers, but when I have a bit more time to spare, I like to try to get a little bit of fresh air, so I go to various spots on campus and take just a moment to forget about my ~~dungeon~~ lab for a while.

Finally, dinner time. If I'm eating at home, I usually fix myself a bowl of pasta and sauce (I'm partial to rotini with marinara). It's quick, but hot. I like to experiment with various kinds of ways of preparing the sauce (different spices, mixing in shredded cheese, adding red pepper flakes - not for the faint of heart). When I'm feeling particularly adventurous, I'll even go so far as to make some garlic toast. I usually drink a glass of grape juice with dinner, and follow it up with ice cream or a milkshake for dessert.

The nice thing about my diet plan is that I can seem to live off of about $20-$25 per week and still eat a relatively healthy balance of food. Plenty of fruit. Plenty of dairy. *Lots* of carbs. The most expensive groceries are the milk, ice cream, and juice, which all last a week and end up costing $13 or so. Pasta and sauce, on the other hand, only costs $3 for the whole week.

I don't like to think of myself as a penny pincher, but I try to save money on the daily necessities, giving me the cash to spare to eat out maybe once or twice a week, perhaps even indulging in some luxury every other month or so. I don't want to be one of those guys who takes his newfound freedom and spends himself into debt within weeks of starting off on his own. After all, and I'm budgeting things that I *know* that I can afford, which is what part of being a responsible adult is all about.
