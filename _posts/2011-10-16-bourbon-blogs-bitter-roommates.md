This weekend I went all out and made something that I've wanted to make for a long, long time - Sweet Bourbon-Glazed Salmon. It's one of my favorite dishes to get when I go to the steakhouse, because it has such a unique and sweet twang to it. While looking for a recipe, I stumbled upon one of my [new favorite blogs](http://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/03/crispy-bourbon-glazed-salmon/). Be sure to check it out, it's a lot like mine, except the author doesn't pretend that her blog is about life as a Ph.D. student like I do.

I wasn't aware that you could broil salmon in the oven like this, so I whipped out my trusty tin foil and cookie sheet to give it a shot. While it was cooking, it smelled a lot nicer than all of the things that I've fried, since frying things in grease (like chicken) lets out a kind of smoke that really burns my eyes. This, on the other hand, was filled the air with a pleasant garlic-and-peppery aroma. Salmon is my favorite kind of fish, since it has a very mild taste, and with the sweet glaze on top of it, it all turned out to be a really fancy dinner.

Of course, my jealous, obnoxious, and freeloading roommate wouldn't let me make this without saying something about it. Whenever I try to cook anything nice, whether it's fried chicken, salmon, or even toast, he gets all worked up over it and starts throwing a tantrum.

I'm, uh, talking about my smoke detector. It's not so much a smoke detector as it as a cooking detector, because if I'm cooking anything that's not macaroni or ramen, then it goes off and keeps going off for as long as the oven has power. Since it's way up on the ceiling, I do my best to shut it up by fanning it with a towel, but that ends up working my arms out until they're sore, which in turn, ruins my appetite. I'm sure it means well, and is just doing its best to help, but it's a pain to deal with all of the false positives that it reports.

I think that when I spent time fighting the smoke detector, I ended up letting my fish cook a bit too long, so it was a little crustier than it should have been. In spite of all of that, tonight's dinner was still very nice. While I mostly followed the recipe for the glaze to the letter, I didn't add the dried mustard to it, which I have a feeling might have made the glaze stick a little better, since it ended up being a really runny sauce when I drizzled it over my fish.

Not only have I discovered a new cooking blog, I also bought a [cookbook prepared by my University's Office of International Services](https://ois.ncsu.edu/public/cookbook/index.cfm), so between the two of these, I'm sure I'll have no shortage of recipes to try out on my weekend cooking adventures.
