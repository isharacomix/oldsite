A while back, I ran into a really interesting website called <a href="http://shelr.tv">Shelr.tv</a>, which is a website like Youtube, except instead of rich multimedia videos, it collects terminal "shellcasts", which record the changes in the text of a terminal and then allow you to play them back. It's pretty awesome, especially for us scruffy computer hackers.

I don't do much work in the terminal - I use Gedit for my code editing, Firefox for my browser, and the terminal to hunt down programs and run my compilers. My predominant usage of the terminal is actually for gaming, since I like playing Roguelikes quite a bit (maybe I'll give a RogueLike review some day soon). I've been trying to use Emacs more often for my file editing, but I can't bring myself to work in such a constrained terminal when I'm so used to the freedom I have with GUI editors. While I'll never use an IDE, I find myself more productive in the GUI, and that's more important than using a terminal for everything - even if it makes me look cooler and more pretentious.

In addition to recording the terminal,  Shelr has recently added support for catching audio via the microphone, making it possible to record commentary as well. This will make it much easier to create "how-to" videos by overlaying what you have to say on top of the shellcast. While there isn't support for uploading this audio yet, it's currently in their Github bug tracker, so I'm looking forward to support for it! Even if they don't include it on their server (due to hosting concerns), each shellcast is encoded as a simple JSON file, it's very easy to share them with others (though sadly, I can't embed them on Wordpress!).

The one feature that I really wish it had is support for terminal livestreaming. There's another similar site called <a href="http://codestre.am">Codestre.am</a>, which is quite a bit uglier and not as open source as Shelr, but its big advantage is that you can stream your terminal to the world, and allow people to hold discussions while watching you work in realtime. This would be a great way to host an online course in Linux or coding basics without having to resort to more bandwidth-expensive options like Youtube or Skype.

Every hour, three days worth of video is uploaded to Youtube. I can't imagine any independent project having remotely enough space to host the same amount of content as Youtube. Terminal shellcasts can display orders of magnitude more content using orders of magnitude less space than on Youtube, since the text encoding is nothing compared to full video. It'll be great if Shelr picks up in popularity, especially among both teachers of Linux and programming, but also with other groups, like Roguelike developers, BBS enthusiasts, and ASCII-Artists.

You can check out Shelr on the <a href="http://shelr.tv">Shelr.tv web site</a>, and follow development <a href="https://github.com/shelr">on Github</a>.
