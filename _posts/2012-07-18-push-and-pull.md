title: Push and Pull
---

Recently, I stopped forwarding my posts from Twitter to Facebook, for good reason. Let's just face it, social networking has changed the way we work with the Internet in ways we never would have realized. This is a post I've been wanting to make for a long time that actually has connections to classroom technology, but I never really got around to writing it. Well, here we are.

First of all, let me talk about <em>push</em> and <em>pull</em> with respect to information. "Push" information is delivered from sender to the recipient, and includes things like e-mail and snail mail. "Pull" information is information that is posted where the recipient has to actively go and find it, such as on a web page. For those of us who are lazy, we like it better when our professors "push" their announcements to us than those who put the onus on us to go to their obscure web site/Moodle/Piazza/whatever site to find announcements for ourselves.

So where do sites like Facebook come into play here? When I put a status update in my feed, am I "pushing" it onto my friends? Or are did my friends sign up to "pull" it from me? And that's where the water gets murky.

There is no hard and fast definition for where "pull" ends and "push" begins. I consider e-mail to be the definitive example of a "push" system, but what if your job requires you to have a seperate business e-mail address and personal e-mail address (and you can't link the two)? While the higher ups may feel like they're pushing the information by sending it to your work e-mail address, it feels more like you're doing extra work by logging into that foreign account and "pulling" the updates.

In other words, a "push" based notification works when I put the information where you would expect to find it, as opposed to a "pull" where I set up a common ground for everybody and require you to meet me half-way. For folks who actually use Facebook on a daily basis (which, surprise, doesn't include me), having things appear in your news feed makes it feel like people are pushing their updates in your way. We "like" pages so that updates will come to us rather than forcing us to go and find them, and we like that.

Twitter, on the other hand, already has an established role. It's an opt-in push-based network. Nobody is following me who doesn't want to see what I have to say. I feel bad when I post a tweet knowing it's going to end up on my timeline in the way of my friends who mean well, but really have no interest in what I'm actually doing. It's kind of like that family member who forwards "funny e-mail" chains to everyone they know. Now that I've delinked the two accounts, it doesn't happen anymore, and I feel less guilty about participating in the "twitterverse" (livetweeting, and all that other newfangled silliness).

People who follow you on Twitter follow you because they are interested in your content, while people on Facebook add you as a friend because they are interested in <em>you</em> (or are interested in showing you off). That's why cross-posting to Facebook is considered "pushy" to other people even though it's not "pushy" to me.

I'm still going to push my blog posts to my feed, but I'm going to add another link in the chain and let Wordpress do it directly rather than doing it through Twitter. As always, if you want to follow the blog for some bizarre reason, there are a pile of different ways you can do so from Twitter to RSS, so I'm sure you'll find something that works for you.
