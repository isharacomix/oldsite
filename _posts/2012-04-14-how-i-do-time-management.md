title: How I do time management

It's been a while since I've written anything, but it's because the end of the semester is nigh, and as they say, it's <em>crunch time</em>. I'm working on a paper, I'm wrapping up course projects, and I'm going several days a week without any sleep. That's just a day in the life of a graduate student, though, right?

So let's talk about <strong>time management</strong>. As it turns out, I may have bitten off a bit more than I can chew this semester - there's a reason why they let you take "research credits"! Research is a huge time commitment and classes have a tendency of pushing a lot of short term responsibilities to your attention, which creates a shortage of time and energy that can be adequately split between the two. Effective time management is critical to deal with the short-term commitments of coursework and the long-term commitments of research. Sometimes it feels like there's not enough hours in the day to get things done, but in reality, there's actually a lot of time hidden in 24 hours.

So in order to take advantage of that time you have to do a lot of restructuring. And the first part of it all is to <strong>create a schedule and stick to it</strong>. When you sit down in your lab, you know how long you will have before you have to get up and do something else. So take the first fifteen minutes to go through your e-mail, check your blogs, and plan out what you want to get done by dividing that time into discrete chunks, say, 20 minutes each. Don't let time blocks run over, and don't let other things come into the time blocks.

In order to avoid burning yourself out, it's also important to <strong>plan for breaks</strong>. After three or four blocks of working, schedule a break to catch up with the interruptions that came up during your work. One strategy that takes advantage of this work/break dynamic is an approach called <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">the Pomodoro technique</a>. One way to stop interruptions from pressuring you to switch away from the work you're doing is to know that there will be some free time coming in the next ten minutes to let you deal with it.

Plan a few blocks to be "catch-up" blocks so that if you really have something to do for the day, you can still schedule time to wrap up things that were left unfinished in previous blocks. Don't push blocks back, but treat the idea of doing different work as a break. Sometimes it's easier to come back to one project after working on something else. If you manage to get all your work done (which is unlikely), you can go home early and take a much-needed nap.

Finally, <strong>do some research every day</strong>. The funny thing about research is that unlike homework, you don't "finish" it. It's a daily task, and it can't be written down as something that you can "finish". So plan to do something relevant each day. In the same vein, it's a good idea to schedule time to read current research papers maybe two or three times a week. This keeps you up to date and your mind filled with fresh ideas. Your annotated bibliography should be a living document that's constantly growing.

Putting too much structure in your day adds a lot of overhead that makes it harder to work, but too little structure makes it easy to get distracted. It's important to strike a balance that allows you to maximize the work you do during a period of time, maybe even leaving enough of a block to write a blog entry! :)
