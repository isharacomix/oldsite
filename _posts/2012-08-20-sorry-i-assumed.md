title: Sorry, I assumed...
---

*<strong>Update, December 2013</strong>: It's interesting how much more aware I've become of my own privilege since writing this article. For a modern take on this topic, please see <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2013/08/09/of-programming-and-privilege">this article written ironically in the same month a year later</a>*

You know, I like to make fun of the fact that I still use the same laptop that I got when I was in high school. "LOL! I had to use dial-up when I was a Freshman in college. ROFL! I still use a dumb feature phone." So when the speaker at a tech conference tells us that he <em>knows</em> that everyone in the audience has a smart phone, I just laugh and starting pulling the "I'm a poor Grad Student" lines. During high school, people always used to assume that I was better off than I was, and it wasn't until I was in college that I figured out why.

I'm not shy about the fact that my family was dirt poor. We didn't have the Internet, we didn't have smart phones, and the only computer we had was literally the machine that I'm composing this blog entry on. Despite this, I can't count how many homework assignments required me to have access to the Internet or asked me to e-mail materials to my teachers. While they were more often than not willing to accommodate me (because I let them know the problem early and didn't keep it to myself until the last minute like many of my peers did), the fact that I didn't have access to this technology was so alien to them that I needed to constantly remind them about my situation.

I'm what you might call a millennial, a member of <em>Generation Y</em>, meaning that I have grown up in a time when technology has become nearly ubiquitous. So it stands to reason why my instructors would assume that <em>everyone</em> has access to this Internet thing, right? At first, I was willing to scream "Classism" because it honestly felt like I was being left out of the loop because I wasn't just assumed, but expected, to have access to this technology that we quite frankly could not afford.

As I went through college, however, I started to understand that the reason why people though I was better off than I was in reality was because I was always the token "computer genius". It seemed kind of odd that I could know so much about technology and the Internet without having access to them myself. When you think about it that way, it makes sense... if you have a high school student who is taking charge fixing computer problems and talking about pursuing a degree in Computer Science, why wouldn't you think he has access to some amazing resources?

I'm quite the success story - I was able to get into a Computer Science program at NC State despite not having home access to the Internet during High School, and now I'm a year on my way to the Ph.D. Even though my life probably would have been more convenient if I had Internet access at home or an always-smartphone, I never <em>needed</em> either one of them. Therefore, I've adopted the stance that just because I'm a Computer Scientist, I don't need to go out and buy every computery thing out there. It's not about money... well, OK, it's mostly about money... but it's also about a sense of restraint and self-control.

That being said, everyone deserves to spoil themselves every once in a while, so I'll be getting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7">Google Nexus 7</a> in the near future. :)
