There have been so many "real" blog entries lately that I haven't done a cooking-related one in a while. I've been hard at work writing, so I figured I'd post an entry saying what I've been eating to keep myself alive lately. In fact, I don't think I've had a real meal in two weeks... my lunches have basically just been a peanut-butter sandwich, a bag of popcorn, and a delicious honey-and-oats granola bar.

When it comes to getting food to eat during the day, it's important to make sure that it's filling and that it won't spoil by the time you open your bag for lunch. Sandwiches make excellent entrees, particularly when high in protein, like peanut butter or meat. I prefer turkey and chicken, and I also like to put a slab of swiss cheese on it as well. Even though I occasionally like a tomato on my sandwich, I prefer not to put it in my lunch since it makes the bread soggy. Peanut-butter is my prime choice, since it lasts forever and is fairly cheap for the number of sandwiches you can make with one jar of the stuff.

If your lab has a microwave, you have the additional benefit of getting to have something warm for lunch! My side of choice in this case is popcorn, since it's salty, warm, and quite filling. However, it's also possible to prepare a hot entree, perhaps from last night's leftovers. Broiled chicken usually heats up well, so long as you have some kind of sauce to put over it to make up for the fact that it might be a bit more bland after cooking it in the microwave. I prefer microwaving broiled chicken more than fried chicken, since fried chicken gets kind of soggy and unpleasant - it's best reheated in dry heat.

Another fun choice is to reheat stir fry. So long as the vegetables are still mostly crisp, it turns out pretty good. I've never been able to reheat home-cooked rice, but the rice you get from Chinese restaurants, which is slightly dry to begin with, heats up very nicely if you sprinkle just a little bit of water in it and toss it in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Or you can just get a rice cooker, which I may break down and buy one of these days.

Finally, dessert! Cookies are a great way to wrap up any lunch. Fruit bars and granola bars with a bit of chocolate are also a good choice. I've always found that a little chocolate helps the brain work a bit better, so I've always made it a point to have chocolate before an exam, and I've started putting chocolate chip cookies into my lunch as well.

Wrapping up, it's probably not a good idea to get too fancy in the lab. Hot plates are a no-no, both because they are against my university policy and because they are just too dangerous in a place where science is being done. So you need to be able to plan ahead when preparing lunch so that you can make the most of your environment. Also, a great way to increase the number of containers to carry your lunch in is to order lots of Chinese takeout. When it comes in the nice, plastic containers, those are usually microwave safe and good for storing the messier options like stir-fry.

By the way, I know it may sound odd, but I have a strict No-Ramen policy for the duration of my Ph.D. Even <em>I</em> have standards.
