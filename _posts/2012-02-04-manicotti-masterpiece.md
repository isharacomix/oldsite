Time for more cooking adventures! I've been working my way up to creating the <b>Perfect Italian Dinner<sup>TM</sup></b>, and one step at a time, I manage to add something new and exciting to the ensemble. It started off with putting shredded swiss cheese in my marinara sauce while it heats up, and it's grown to be a true manicotti masterpiece.

First of all, the big picture: manicotti shells stuffed with ricotta cheese laced with garlic and oregano powder. Served on a bed of penne rigate, covered in spicy marinara sauce cooked with all the good italian spices. On top of that, a thick and creamy swiss cheese sauce, and garlic-coated breadsticks on the side. Served with a glass of grape juice and eaten (hopefully) without making a mess.

There was one major success and one major failure last night. The success was the breadsticks, while the failure was the swiss cheese sauce. I'm not even going to link to the recipe, since I don't want them to get any traffic, but apparently I had way too much milk, not nearly enough flour, and I don't think I used enough cheese either. I followed the directions to the letter, but in the end, I ended up making this weird milk with cheese clumps in it, and that was hardly appetizing.

On the other hand, the garlic breadsticks turned out <i>perfectly</i>. This was my second attempt to work with home-made pizza dough, and it turned out much better than it did when I made the buffalo chicken things. I think I got the hang of how to knead the dough without making a horrendously sticky mess all over the place, though I can't help but think I was able to make more dough last time. I may have not used enough water. Either way, they turned out delicious. I melted some butter and put some oregano leaves and garlic powder in the mix and brushed it onto them like a pro.

In lieu of the cheese sauce I couldn't make, I just shredded cheese directly on top of the mix. I've recently started liking this a bit better than just putting the cheese in the marinara while it cooks, since I get that "melted cheese" look as I start to stir the noodles. You have to be really fast to get this to work, otherwise your pasta cools down and the cheese doesn't melt, but I've been getting faster at this. As a side effect, I use a lot more of the kitchen now. I think I had no less than five dirty pots and bowls from the preparation of this little dinner, since I had cooking sheets, boiling water, cheese sauce failure, and dough mixing. There was just too much mess for me to deal with, so I decided to finally give in and wait until after dinner before I bother with cleaning it up. After all, it's not going anywhere.

No, really. It isn't.
