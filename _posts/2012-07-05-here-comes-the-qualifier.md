title: Here Comes the Qualifier
---

In less than one week, I'm going to be taking my Written Qualifying Examination for the Ph.D. in Computer Science. The calm demeanor in which I write this post completely belies the nervous excitement I feel right now as I prepare to take this tremendous step forward in my career. As I have been doing research since my first day in the Ph.D. program, I was set up to take my Qualifier earlier than most other students, though it's still unusual to take it so soon after starting.

As I've no doubt said before, the Ph.D. in Computer Science is divided into three major milestones: the Qualifier, the Preliminary, and the Defense. The Qualifier is my opportunity to prove to the Department that I am, indeed, capable of doing Ph.D.-level research. In some programs, this is done by means of a comprehensive examination, but for our department, we have students write a conference-level paper and then present it to their examination committee. Passage of the exam is based on the technical rigor of the paper, the originality of the work, and the quality of the oral presentation. I'm not really worried about the exam, since I'm fully familiar with the material (I've spent a year on this project) and the paper I'll be presenting was accepted into a conference as well! I'm confident that that I'll be able to demonstrate my aptitude for research.

One technical aspect of the exam is that the paper I present must be entirely my own work. Unlike a conference paper, where the advisor will rewrite sections of a paper for the conference, the paper submitted to the exam committee must be representative of my work with the advisor's high-level guidance. As such, getting the paper written was a five-month labor of love. I'll never forget the first comments I saw on my paper...

 * Not rigorous
 * Imprecise
 * Lacks <em>discipline</em>

For my first paper, this makes sense. I wasn't a disciplined scientist yet. My results were impressive, but I wasn't able to express them in a rigorous and precise way, and this took away from the value of my work. I had a tendency to drift from idea to idea in a very hard-to-follow fashion, but since papers are a linear medium, I have to deliver the main idea of my paper linearly. Define terms before using them, define them precisely, and use them consistently after their definition. Don't leave gaps, and don't introduce needless repetition. Be convincing, compelling, and - above all - rigorous.

Since writing this paper, I've already seen my writing begin to mature. I think in terms of how to express and motivate the problems I intend to solve. I justify why I use the approaches I do, and I connect them back to the motivating problem that drives the paper. I provide my intuition in plain English before I begin discussing technical details. While this may never be particularly apparent in the writing on my blog, since I write these things for fun and do a maximum of about three revisions per entry, I'm excited to see how my technical writing grows in the future!

So bring on the Qualifier! I'm ready for it!
