Whenever you move into a new neighborhood, it's always a good idea to find out who your neighbors are (and eventually introduce yourself). It's good citizenship and makes your life a lot more pleasant. So I did a [tag search for "phd"](https://en.wordpress.com/tag/phd/) and found out the other folks hanging out here on WordPress that blog about the things that I do. In what I would consider to be good spirit, I've decided to follow their work (so I don't have to keep bookmarks on my local, volatile machine) and provide a link to their stuff here.

The coolest spot I found was *[The Thesis Whisperer](https://thethesiswhisperer.wordpress.com/)* which is a newspaper-style blog featuring authors from all around academia discussing the writing process with their own observations and insights. It looks like a great place to join in the discourse of other academics, so I look forward to putting my foot in the door over there. A related spinoff is the *[The Research Whisperer](https://theresearchwhisperer.wordpress.com/)* which talks more about the world of research as opposed to the world of writing about research (where my Professor makes the claim that the two are actually one in the same).

Then I came across the very distinguished-looking *[Cap and Gown](https://capandgown.wordpress.com/)*, which puts a historical perspective on academia (which I eat up like candy). Part of the fun of pursuing an advanced degree isn't just for the monetary awards or the scholarly achievements, but also for the honor of becoming part of an age-old profession that is steeped in culture and tradition all its own.

And of course, I found a number of personal blogs, such as *[The Guide to Grad School Survival](https://guidetogradschoolsurvival.wordpress.com/)* (which was the blog that linked me to *TTW* in the first place). The newspaper-style, multiple-author blogs are cool, don't get me wrong, but one of the cool thing about the blogosphere is that you have a bunch of individual people writing about their own experiences and observations, which allows you to identify with a person that you follow for a period of time. I hope I can find a lot more of these so I can look towards this kind of writing for inspiration and guidance (and I hope others might find mine helpful in the same way!).

Of course, these blogs are very serious about their subject matter. I also managed to step back from the grindstone and find *[Surviving Your Stupid, Stupid Decision to go to Grad School](http://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Your-Stupid-Decision-School/dp/0307589447)*, a book by Dr. Adam Ruben. I was linked to that by this [lovely little video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xjs6iTjdJc).

So these are some of the places I've found to help find guidance, encouragement, and humor to help make the journey to the Ph.D. a successful one. And of course, I always keep Dr. Jorge Cham's [PHD Webcomic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php) in my RSS reader so I can keep up with the authoritative source of Graduate procrastination.
