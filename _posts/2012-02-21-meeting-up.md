title: Meeting Up
---

So I just got back from my first "Meet Up" event this evening, a social run in lovely downtown Raleigh, and I'd like to say, I kind of like the idea of that. It's great that there's <a href="http://meetup.com">a website</a> out there designed to facilitate the interaction of people with other people. Unlike the Fac... thing. I've already talked about it before, but most social networking sites are mechanisms for staying in touch, but hardly effective when it comes to meeting new folks. And for someone who spends all his time in the lab, I need all the help I can get when it comes to meeting new people.

Tonight was actually apparently the "big game" against our rival school, <a href="http://unc.edu">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, which I didn't really care about except for the worries that the roads would be packed and parking would be non-existent. But as it turns out, spectator sports are about more than a bunch of sweaty men running around in circles trying to kill each other to take control of a ball. It's an excuse for social interaction. To get together with other folks for no other reason than to cheer on the folks that are playing in the court or on the field and representing their University in the way that they enjoy. And that's admirable.

We "geeks" have our own sorts of things like these. Cons, game nights, big parties where we indulge in the guilty pleasures that we love, like light sabers and 20-sided dice. Once again, you get a wide variety of individual personalities together over a relatively shallow interest.

*"Oh I like that game too! What's your name?"*

The problem with me is that I don't like crowds. I prefer very small, discussion-oriented get-togethers, like the workshops where we get about eight people at a table to talk about teaching, or research, or whatever. That's large enough so that it's not just a few people going back and forth, but small enough to avoid the conversations fragmenting and splitting up the table. Rather than getting together with people over a shallow interest like sports or gamings, you get to dive deeper into the individual personalities at the core of the event, since you are together to explore a topic in depth, and then you meet people with views that either align with yours or are of interest to you.

However, that does have a downside, in that it exposes me to a very small number of people. While I get to know folks in greater depth in these sorts of events, I think it would be healthy to get to know a somewhat larger breadth of individuals. Behind each of the faces at the sporting events, or at the game nights, or in the bars, is an individual human being. Maybe it's worth it to go to a few of these Meetup events, even if it's just an evening run around the city. If I do, I might just get a chance to meet some of these interesting folks.
