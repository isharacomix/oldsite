NC State just recently enabled consumer apps on our domain, meaning that now, we are able to use our <em>@ncsu.edu</em> email addresses to log on to sites like Youtube, Picasa, and (most importantly) Google+. The funny story about me and Google+ is that I originally set up my + account to use my NC State account, until NC State disabled consumer apps, forcing me to create a GMail account to use the fledgling social networking site. Then, as my own site started to grow, I migrated <em>again</em> to my <em>@isharacomix.org</em>, which is used for nearly everything now... including my tablet. While many of our students and faculty are taking advantage of this to create "professional" social networking accounts within the University domain, and I see this as a step in the right direction... with caveats.

Before I begin, let me define a few terms. On the Internet, there is only one <strong>Barry Wayne Peddycord III</strong>. That's me. Regardless of what website I'm on or what username I have, this is my <em>identity</em>. However, when I'm online, I may have many different publicly-facing profiles. There's Barry Peddycord the Ph.D. student in Computer Science, who talks about social media and Graduate Student life. There's also IsharaComix, who likes manga, Minecraft, and can bake one heck of a lasagna dinner. One day, there will even be Mr. Peddycord, the teacher. Each of these public <em>personas</em> represents a different piece of who I am, but add them all up and once again, you get <em>me</em>. While this usage of the terms <em>identity</em> and <em>persona</em> are completely my own (it doesn't reflect the usage in the literature or even popular usage), I still find that it's a pretty good choice of terminology when it comes to trying to illustrate this concept.

While social media has gotten better about allowing you to control who <em>you</em> share with, it is much more difficult to subscribe to certain posts by individuals. Let's say I have separate circles on Google+ for my friends and my students. While I may post updates about my research to both circles, I would generally avoid posting how much I enjoyed the latest episode of <em>My Little Pony</em> where my students could see it. However, while I am the best judge about what I want my audience to see, I am not so good at judging what my audience <em>wants</em> to see - even if I was comfortable with sharing my pony fandom, I don't imagine many of my students would care in the first place.

For this reason, it makes sense that in addition to me deciding who I am willing to share information about myself with, others should be able to decide what information of mine they care about seeing, creating a two-way whitelisted filter. Some friends are willing to suffer through all of the content associated with my identity, ponies and all. Others, particularly my professional connections, should have the option of subscribing to the feeds of specific personas, and still others may want to be considered my friend without really caring at all about anything that I post.

While I could just create a separate blog or a separate Twitter for each of these personas, it feels like all of these social networks I participate in are already competing for the role of my "canonical" public profile, and adding more into the mix just feels even more confusing. Rather than having a bunch of disjoint profiles, it would be ideal to have a single profile that pushes content out to various personas from a "hub" representing the identity. The services that do this the best are blogging sites like Wordpress and Tumblr - you have a single account, and while you normally have your personal blog at <em><strong>yourname</strong>.wordpress.com</em>, you can be an author on any number of other blogs. However, while Wordpress has the functionality that supports this, the best place I've ever seen this is Tumblr.

I've <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/03/03/pinterest-new-social-network">hinted at it before</a>, but the culture of blogging and reblogging is richer on Tumblr than anywhere else I've seen - Tumblr is basically social blogging done right (which often makes me question my Wordpress allegiance). You see a lot of this with the so-called <a href="http://askmlcblobs.tumblr.com/">"ask blogs"</a> that are made for characters of various works of fiction, which are led by owners who run <a href="http://raikissu.tumblr.com/">"mod blogs"</a>. If I was to start role-playing on Wordpress or Twitter, I would kill off the few followers I have, so having a persona that people can opt-in to is extremely important when you want to goof around on social media (or more seriously, do something like livetweet a conference) you don't bombard followers who weren't expecting that kind of thing when they decided to follow you.

So to bring things full-circle, it's not like we haven't seen this before. As computers became more mobile, going from desktops and laptops to smartphones and tablets, there was a growing push for companies to support the devices that employees already had, rather than giving them an extra gadget. This practice is referred to as <em>BYOD</em>, or <em>Bring Your Own Device</em>. Rather than having one device for personal use and one for professional use, they have a single device that they use for all purposes (albeit with multiple accounts).

To me, social network identities are no different. I believe we may see another push in our increasingly social culture for <em>Bring Your Own Identity</em>, where rather than duplicating our social media presence for multiple audiences, we can consolidate our online personas behind a single identity. We've seen hints of this with social media breaks like the one with <del>@PhoneDog_Noah</del> <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/11/14/225205/tech-site-sues-ex-employee-claiming-rights-to-his-twitter-account">@noahkravitz</a>, who served as a Twitter persona for his company, and kept his followers when he went off to do his own thing. Now that even social networks are referring to themselves as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/08/29/googles-eric-schmidt-says-plus-is-an-identity-service-not-a-social-network/">identity services</a>, maybe we'll see more of this trend.

Or maybe I'm the only person who doesn't mind my students knowing I watch <em>My Little Pony</em>.
