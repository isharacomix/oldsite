Today I had the distinguished pleasure of attending a cooking class by a local cooking enthusiast, the wonderful and sociable <a href="http://deliziedelizie.com">Claire Idhammar</a>. She recently launched the Raleigh Culinary Delights Cooking Class, and I have to say, it was a wonderful experience. While I like to fancy myself to be at least passable at cooking, I have a tendency to do things that I'm familiar with, and I'm not quite adventurous enough to really expand my abilities. This experience was a wonderful way to try something very different from what I'm used to doing, and I got to socialize with other culinary artists in the process!

So we basically made an awesome Italian dish together, but there was no pasta and marinara in this one (wild, huh?). Instead, we had Porcini Risotto, Veal and Chicken Milanese, Broccolini, and some Polenta. Except for the Veal and Chicken, I didn't know any of those words going in, so I learned a lot of vocabulary, first off.

As it turns out, I've never actually sliced any fresh vegetables for the meals I've prepared at home. I've usually used whole vegetables and packaged spices - so no fresh cut onions, peppers, or anything like that. It's a bit embarassing, but I had the experience of actually slicing an onion and chopping up garlic for the first time. I'm a far cry from being a super amazing chef, but I think I'll be able to do some fancy things for anyone who ever happens to come over, right?

The main course was the Porcini Risotto - it was rice cooked in a mushroom, wine, and chicken-stock soup, making the rice very rich and flavorful, covered with a thick and creamy gravy-esque texture... nothing like the steamed white rice I make for stir fry. I typically don't like mushrooms, but the flavor was so vibrant that I really enjoyed it - where the flavor for the Risotto was really rich, the Broccolini helped tone it down for me, so there was a good balance of flavors on my plate.

We finished off the meal with a really awesome dessert - it started off with a brownie, topped with yogurt and fruit, and a little ice cream on top. This whole thing came together so wonderfully - the yogurt had this effect that felt as though it neutralized the sweetness of the brownie, accentuating the chocolate flavor, while letting the fruit and ice cream provide the sweetness. It was a great, simple dessert - a perfect way to surprise company after a meal.

Cooking in a group is a great experience - everyone has the opportunity to learn from one another, to share experiences, and to struggle while fighting towards a common goal. While I'm certainly looking forward to the next cooking class, this has gotten me even more motivated to try to start a cooking club for students and recent graduates - I think I'd have more in common with a group like that than anything else, though I'd love to build my repertoire up a bit before I try to launch it!
