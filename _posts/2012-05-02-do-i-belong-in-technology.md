I sometimes have to wonder that, despite being all about Computer Science and technology and stuff, I have a tendency to use a wide array of less-sophisticated technology in my daily life. I don't have a smartphone, meaning I don't have a digital calendar running my life. I don't keep my research notes on a fancy wiki. I have good, old-fashioned, DRM-free pen and paper. And even though I can't run Linux on all of this, I'm actually OK with that.

Let's start with the research notebook. I firmly believe that every self-respecting scientist and engineer should keep a string-bound, marble-covered composition book, written in ink (and optionally, highlighters). There are practical and aesthetic reasons for this belief. The practical reason is that when you're in the middle of a patent dispute or having the validity of your results being challenged (which I hope <em>never</em> happens to any of you), having a well-kept notebook with dated, signed pages can save your life. And let's just face it, when I'm out and about, I prefer to just have a book I can open up and scribble something down in, whether it's text, a picture, or whatever. I could never get past the awkwardness of writing on a tablet.

Then there's my pocket calendar. It's seriously been the biggest life-saver ever. I used to keep my schedule on sheets of paper that I carried around with me, only to lose them every time I changed clothes. When that happened, I ended up having to remind myself of what my schedule was like for the next week. My calendar, on the other hand, is about as big as my wallet (though a bit more full), making it harder to lose. I can also flip through it at my leisure when I'm bored to refresh my mind about what I need to prioritize for the week. While it doesn't give me automatic reminders like a smart phone can, I prefer to look at my calendar and know I have an appointment at 3 than to have an alarm tell me that.

So what's the problem with all this technology? Everything is in its own place. You never accidentally find something you aren't looking for. It's organized!

*That's the problem.*

When everything is organized, you never stumble upon that little thought you had at one point, but then forgot about. When you have to flip through a lab notebook to find something you're looking for, however, you might stumble across something that had completely slipped your mind. When you have to rummage through your data, you bring old information back to the surface again. This keeps information from going stale, which is important in the fast-moving world of research! I mean, sure, you can tag your ideas "TODO" or "FIXME"... but be honest... how many of you actually listen to those little comments?

It's true that having things on paper makes collaboration harder, but the point of a notebook isn't to collaborate - it's to manage your own information. When collaborating, I love bringing computers into the picture. But so far, for me, no computer can compete with the natural feeling I get from holding a composition book in my hands. When I find something that can, believe me, you'll be the first to know.
