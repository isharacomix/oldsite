title: Christmas Fun Times
---

Merry Christmas and stuff! I can't believe it's been a whole week since my last post. I'm such a lazy grad student. But when I have all these new toys to play with, who can find the time to blarg? Not this guy! I can't even find the time to cook, I'm so absorbed by all of these fun little gadgets!

Actually, for my first post-graduate Christmas, I had a fairly modest holiday season, and I wouldn't prefer it any other way. I don't ask for a whole lot as it is - a book, a video game or two, a bit of funding for my tuition - but my recent stance against consumerism makes me even less inclined to ask folks to give money to Big Media and ask for big-name game titles and the like. Instead, I would prefer to buy <a href="http://humblebundle.com">DRM-Free Indie Games</a>, since they cost a lot less, and you get an actual game that you can play, rather than paying for the privilege of entering some ethereal legal relationship with the providers of the content.

So for my Christmas, my two gifts of note were a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_%26_Noble_Nook">Barnes and Noble Nook</a>, and **THE** book on NP-Completeness, <a>Garey and Johnson's *Computers and Intractability*</a>.

The Nook is an interesting device. I was hoping that it would be more useful for web browsing and e-mail management that I could do without booting my computer up, but it looks like that isn't the case, since browsing is slow and clumsy. However, it DOES do a good job of making it possible for me to read my research papers and technical manuals without having to worry about having to print 20 pages of material for our group meetings. I'm sure that as I get used to it, I'll be able to do a better job of using it, but I think I'm best off using it purely as an e-reader rather than trying to turn it into a general purpose tablet.

For the second item, Garey and Johnson's book makes a great addition to any Computer Scientist's library. This book is essentially a guide to what NP-completeness is and how to prove it. While most of this material is pretty much covered by any serious course in Algorithms, the real value of the book comes from its appendix of 300 NP complete problems in several different fields of Computer Science, from Graph Theory to Scheduling Problems. My research direction may not be in the realm of computability theory, but I'd still like to take a few more classes in the field before I graduate, so this book has more practical use than just sitting on my shelf making me feel important.

So now that that's over, I'm back to work. It didn't feel like much of a vacation, granted, but that doesn't matter much, since science marches on no matter what holidays are happening. The holiday haze is beginning to clear, and I'm starting to see my next semester slowly start to come over the horizon. Let's see if we can complete another semester and survive until the Grad Blog's first year anniversary!
