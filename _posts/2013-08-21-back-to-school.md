Today was the first day of my third year in the Ph.D. program! Time to take a
look at where I've been and where I'm going.

This past summer, I got my Master of Science in Computer Science, which was an
amazing step forward in my career. When I came to NC State five years agao, I
never imagined I'd get an advanced degree, let alone a Ph.D. I'm in a good lab,
have great colleagues, and have even started on a research project that I would
like to turn into a dissertation! I am tremendously excited about the future
in the long term, not just in the coming year.

Last semester, I completed my second semester as a lab TA, meaning that I now
have the credentials I need to receive my **Certificate of Accomplishment** in
Teaching. The CoAT program has been a major motivator for my work, and with that
behind me, the next milestone is **Preparing the Professoriate**, a substantially
more involved program where I work not only as a TA, but as a co-teacher, leading
in lecture and course design. This is a very exciting chapter of my career, since
I'm collaborating with a fantastic advisor on a class that I happen to love
(C and Software Tools).

I'm taking two courses this semester - Educational Data Mining with my advisor,
and Theory of Technology Integration with the College of Education online. I've
also signed up for two MOOCs, [Big Data in Education](https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata-edu)
and [Video Games and Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/videogameslearning),
both starting in October and sure to be very fun learning experiences.

My ultimate goal is to have my preliminary examination completed and achieve
doctoral candidacy by this time next year. I've had a few delays with the
development of #8bitmooc, but those aside, I should be able to deliver this
course and have some fun data to look at by Spring, giving me a summer to put
together a dissertation proposal on what to do with it.

When I started in grad school, I didn't really know what I wanted. Looking back
at what I've written and how I've changed in all that time is kind of amazing.
I'm really happy with where I am and where I'm going.
