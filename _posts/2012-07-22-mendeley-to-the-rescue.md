title: Mendeley to the Rescue!
---

After posting my <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/07/16/tag-youre-it">less than a week ago</a> begging for a system that would just let me tag things in Microblogging style, I can't believe that the program I've been looking for all this time just fell into my lap. Ladies and gentlemen, this program is called <a href="http://mendeley.com"><em>Mendeley</em></a>.

On the surface, Mendeley looks like "just another reference manager" like Zotero, but under the hood, it has actually turned out to be exactly what I needed. Basically, just like any other reference manager, you add citations for the papers you read to an evergrowing portfolio so that you can export your citations whenever you need them. Like Zotero, you can classify metadata fields to your heart's content, organize by author, mark articles as unread or put them in your favorites. It has everything you would normally expect.

The feature I've been using in Zotero its "notes" support. I create a note and add it to every paper I read, and it contains either a reflection or a watered down summary of the paper. But as you may recall from earlier this week, that's something I wanted to get away from. I want a system for <em>annotating</em> my documents while I read them, and then a system for <em>summarizing</em> my documents afterwards. Zotero doesn't really support that.

Mendeley does... <em>and oh does it</em>.

Basically, Mendeley's annotations system is very simple. Rather than embedding the annotations in the PDFs (which is platform dependent and hardly portable), it instead slaps little sticky notes on top of the PDFs and stores them in its own database. The PDF reader is very lightweight - <del datetime="2012-07-23T15:34:06+00:00">it doesn't even support text highlighting</del><sup>1</sup> - but that doesn't matter. What matters is that you can put your annotations in the context of the document as you read it and as you see it.

Of course, if that's all that it offers, I wouldn't normally be impressed. But then I figured out something I didn't think of earlier.

<em>You can do this with anythinig.</em>

Think about it. When you go to a conference, you can annotate the slides from the presenter's presentation. You can annotate the slides from your regular lectures. You can even annotate poster presentations! The possibilities for contextual annotation are endless! Download and print popular articles as PDFs - add them to your library and annotate them too! The possibilities really are endless!

Furthermore, the Mendeley site has some fancy social networkingish features that could really help facilitate collaboration in a research group. Sharing annotations on papers and creating a dialogue between members of the group is a pretty amazing capability (when you get past the questionable copyright issues on the matter).

Like I mentioned <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/06/04/am-i-being-too-open">way back when</a>, I'm not sure I'm so comfortable putting all of my reading and comments in the "cloud", but in this case - especially since it's a private cloud - I don't think I have an issue with it. Plus, when I add articles to my portfolio, I actually lend a hand to the Mendeley folks by contributing to their metadata archive of all of the papers that they store, making it easier for my colleagues to find paper. That's an initiative I can get behind.

I don't like that Mendeley is a closed-source application, but they keep the data in standard formats making it easy to backup and port to other reference managers. Plus, they make their Android API open to developers. As of yet, there isn't an Android app that will let you annotate documents on the go, but can you imagine how handy that would be when you go to conferences and see those presentations?

If you're on Mendeley, <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/barry-peddycord-iii/">look me up</a>.

 <sub><strong>1</strong>: As it turns out, you <em>can</em> highlight text. The default tool is the "grabby hand", but you can switch to text highlighting in the main toolbar up at the top of the window. I'm not sure how I overlooked it, but thanks to Ricardo for pointing it out!</sub>
