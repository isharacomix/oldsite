*"Suitable attire is business casual..."*

*"Dress code: Business casual..."*

*"... attendees are asked to wear business casual..."*

Let's talk about *overloading*. Overloading is a technical term in Computer Science for when a symbol or function is given multiple meanings depending on the context. For example, consider the two following lines of Python:

    a = 2+2
    b = "foo"+"bar"


In this case, *a* would be equal to 4, but *b* would be equal to "foobar", because the + symbol is overloaded. In the context of two integers, it means addition, but in the context of two strings, it means concatenation.

The consequence of overloading is that when you come to a line of code like this:

    c = d + e

you have no idea what the + symbol means because you don't know what *d* and *e* are. Now don't get me wrong, overloading isn't necessarily a bad thing. When used *correctly*, it makes programming very flexible, and because computer languages are very well-structured, you can get away with it without confusing too many people. In an ill-defined and baffling language like English, on the other hand, it just ends up confusing and frustrating people.

When I hear the words "business casual", I (as a gentleman) immediately think of long-sleeve button-down shirts with ties, but due to the cultural drift in what counts as "overdressed", wearing a tie clashes with the idea of casual, which suggests dropping the tie and wearing a button-down shirt with slacks. Obviously jeans and t-shirts are never considered "business", but what about polos? And what kinds of shoes should I wear?

Because the term "business casual" is overloaded to mean a lot of different sets of acceptable and unacceptable attire, asking attendees to wear "business casual" is like asking them to wear "what *you* think that *I* think business casual means". While this sort of nonsense may be par for the course among MBAs, I believe it's a crime against society when the organizers of a *technical* conference dare to use the term when they should know how overloaded and ambiguous it is.

It is for this reason that I'm not the least bit shy about sending the organizers an e-mail telling them that they should know better than to use overloaded terminology and asking them for either a finite set of acceptable attire or a finite set of unacceptable attire. If they expect precision in the papers that we submit, then I demand precision in their expectations of the clothes that we wear. If you want me in a suit, tell me, and I'll wear a suit. If you don't mind me showing up in a Hawaiian shirt and flip-flops, let me know so I don't wrinkle my good suit in my luggage. I'm beginning to think that the only reason they use the term "business casual" is to make us all feel self-conscious about ourselves.

So can we just not use that term... please?
