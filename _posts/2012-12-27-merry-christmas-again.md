Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone! I'm sorry about the silence over the past few days. While Christmas is a time to go home and spend quality time with the family, New Year's is when the brother and I get together to party. We've been doing a number of distracting things that have been keeping me from blogging and doing research, mostly watching anime and <em>Doctor Who</em>.

First things first, I suppose... what presents did I get for Christmas this year? For starters, I got another book, George Dyson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turings-Cathedral-Origins-Digital-Universe/dp/0375422773"><em>Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe</em></a>. My mom made me a nice blanket, and I even got a really comfortable new bathrobe, which I'd show you all if I didn't have a policy against taking pictures of myself when I'm in my pajamas. However, the biggest gift I got this year was a nice, tall bookshelf that should be able to hold all of these books I keep getting as I continue in my studies. Of course, it was too big for me to carry back home with me, so I'll have to wait until January before I can set it up in the apartment. After filling up the first locker with every book in my apartment, I'm quite excited about having even more storage space.

You know, ever since middle school, Christmas was always an opportunity to add new entries to my ever-growing collection of video games. It was Christmas when I woke up to see the Playstation and Nintendo 64 sitting in my living room. When I was in college, my dad got us the Xbox 360 and my grandparents got us the Wii. The family asked me every year to tell them which video game I wanted next, and each year going through college, I find that question harder to answer. I was so excited to get a Wii when it first came out, and now I couldn't care less about the Wii U and the rest of the next generation of gaming consoles. It just all seems so pointless. Part of it is probably just the fact that now that I've got a career and social life, I don't really have time to play games anymore. Another part is likely the attitude of the games industry leaving a bad taste in my mouth, as I look forward to the indie games I see on Kickstarter more than any AAA title.

Growing up, I didn't have the discretionary funds to simply go out and buy myself a video game if I was so inclined. This meant that I got a new game two times a year - on my birthday and on Christmas. Because it was so infrequent, it was really something special that I was able to look forward to. Now that I'm in college, I've got the funds to spoil myself, yet more and more often, I find my money going to <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundles</a> and other Indie Games like <a href="http://ahatestory.com/"><em>Analog</em></a>, since I find them much more creative and enjoyable than any of the dozens of "real" games sitting on my shelves collecting dust. Even being a Linux user, I've been able to find a plenty of Free and Open Source games that still continue to entertain and surprise me, like <a href="http://naev.org"><em>Naev</em></a>.

I don't miss the games, I miss the newness that came with them, but I guess that's just what happens when you get older. Now I'm just a jaded old man. The part of Christmas I look forward to now is being able to goof off with my brother and not feel guilty that no research is getting done. We all need to recharge once in a while, right? That's as good a present as any.
