title: Manicottis and Daylight Savings Time
---

For a lucky few regions of the world, tomorrow marks the start of Daylight Savings Time! Or maybe it's the end. I can't remember which... all I know is that this is the fun one where we set our clocks back an hour and (as such) I get to sleep an extra hour! Hooray for me! To celebrate, I prepared manicottis.

Today was a pretty lazy day. After sleeping in, I lounged around the house for a while... doing the Homeworks, watching the Youtubes, playing the Minecrafts, and cooking the Manicottis. While I certainly *could* have gone outside and made myself useful, lethargy got the better of me, and before I knew it, it was already dark.

Manicotti is a lot of fun to make (and eat). Stuffing the noodles can be a bit of a pain, since if you're too rough with them, you'll tear them open and get cheese everywhere. But it's hard to be gentle with them once you've pulled them out of boiling water. After that, we can put them in the oven for 30 minutes and forget about them for a spell.

Unfortunately, the ludicrous amounts of cheese in a manicotti dinner is a bit too much for me, so I like to offset it with either a lot of pasta or a lot of marinara sauce. Being able to spread the cheese over the entire plate makes everything taste really good and doesn't end up too overpowering. Since it's relatively easy to prepare, it's a nice way to improve what would otherwise be a pretty standard noodles-and-sauce dinner.

I should really start looking into ways to spice up my manicottis. The cheese mixture in manicotti and lasagna offers a unique opportunity to include just about anything you want to the dish. Right now, I'm thinking it might be fun to shred some carrots and drop some broccoli in the cheese, or something like that.

Short blog entry is short. Lazy Barry is lazy.
