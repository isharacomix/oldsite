Making responsible decisions is frustrating.

After about three years of not participating in school clubs and social events, I've finally made it a point to start hanging out with my University's Linux User's Group. Unlike the regional LUG that meets once a month, we get together on a weekly basis to talk tech and eat cheap at local restaurants. Quite frankly, this is exactly what I want out of a social group.

Something I've noticed about myself is that the chances that I'll speak to anyone are inversely proportional to the number of people in the group. As I enter an area with a lot of folks, it's baffling how people  can group up into little cliques so quickly and start chatting. I'm able to notice this because I'm not in one of them, of course. On the other hand, when I'm constrained to a smaller crowd of people, I have a substantially easier time loosening up and starting conversations. The LUG gives me just that, and I love it.

Which is why I'm so sad that I had to miss this week's meeting because I had all sorts of work that I had to get done before tomorrow (we were even going to be talking about LaTeX, too). I went back to the parents' home for Labor Day weekend and was promptly put to work doing errands, mowing the lawn, and getting a new registration sticker for my car. As such, all of my schoolwork got pushed back, which has me quite frazzled. I suppose it was an OK visit, since we had a big dinner with the whole family, but I've got a lot going on this week, and not a whole lot of time to get back in the groove.

I suppose it's good to know that even though I'm no longer living under the watchful eye of my parents, and even though I'm bursting out of my shell to interact with my peers and colleagues, I've still got the good sense to know when I have responsibilities that I can't put off any more. There will be other chances for me to hang out with peoples, but one slip-up in my studies could ruin my entire academic career. I have to keep the goal of being a professor in mind, after all! I've already spent more time around other people during this first month of school than I did in my entire Undergraduate career, so I think I'm doing something right.

So with that, back to work. Please don't mention the irony that I'm procrastinating from my homework by writing this blog entry.
