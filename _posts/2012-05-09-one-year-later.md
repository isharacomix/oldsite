I FINALLY FINISHED MY EXAMS! *dies*

So now that that's out of the way, I have just reached the conclusion of my first year in Graduate School, and while I may only be hanging on by a thread, I'm still alive. This day marks the last day of my fourth year and eighth semester here at <a href="http://ncsu.edu">NC State University</a>, and if I was a "normal" student, then this would be the day that I would say good-bye to my friends and go off into the real world. I'm far from normal, however, and as we can see, I'll still be in school for a good while as I have chosen the long and grueling life of the academic for the next four or so years. When it's over, they'll call me Doctor, and maybe that's worth it.

A lot has happened in the past year. I took six classes and completed my requirements for core courses. I managed to keep my GPA above 3.0 so that I wouldn't get kicked out of the program.

I attended eighteen leadership development workshops and become part of the inaugural class of the <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2011/12/14/another-certificate">Preparing Future Leaders Season Pass</a>. During that time, I met the wonderful faculty at the Graduate School of the University, including amazing and motivating mentors like Barbi Honeycutt. It's made me feel better about the line of work I've chosen to pursue, and steeled my resolve to excel in research and teaching.

I broke out of my shell and started interacting with many more people than I ever would have imagined. I've regularly started going to the meetings of the <a href="http://trilug.org">Triangle Linux User's Group</a>, the <a href="http://lug.ncsu.edu">NC State Linux Users Group</a>, and even the <a href="http://sites.ieee.org/encs">local section of the IEEE</a>, discovering colleagues, building connections, and making friends. I've even started to lend my services as the webmaster of the IEEE Section, and will serve as the Secretary of the University LUG starting in the Fall semester.

I saw the world. I attended a workshop at Carnegie-Mellon, a PI meeting at George Mason University, and went to another country for the first time to present a paper at a <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/02/26/greetings-from-beautiful-bonaire">conference on the Caribbean island of Bonaire</a>. I've never flown so much in my life, but it's beginning to become like second nature to me. I love seeing other places, but even more, I love meeting other academics from around the world, and sharing my perspectives on their work and hearing their perspectives on mine.

I've worked on a real research project and <em>almost</em> have a paper ready for publication. I even <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/03/21/graduate-research-symposium/">presented a poster</a> at our University Research Symposium. I've seen first-hand the process, the demands, and the fruits of research. It's an exciting and rewarding experience, even in spite of the pressures of submission deadlines and professors pushing you to work harder to produce results. It's a rewarding feeling to see everything from a research project come together.

And of course, I kept this blog going. I'm very happy with my blog and all of the folks who have joined me on my adventure by reading and responding to it. I'm happy with the folks who put together the banner art that inspires me every time I see my home page. All of you have made writing my observations and reflections an enjoyable experience, so a heartfelt "Thank you" goes out to you for that. I can't wait to come back to the first entries six years from now and read through what I thought when I was just starting out. Six years is a long time for a person. It's a long time to grow, and to change. The only way to find out is to keep writing.

So where do I go from here? Forward, of course. It's been a long year, with plenty of bumps in the road, but I'm quite happy with my progress and where I seem to be going with my life and my career. I'm very happy that I've had the opportunity to take my education to this level. Four years ago, when I started college, I never imagined I'd be here in Graduate School. I thought I'd be off working for a company somewhere on some kind of software, nine-to-five, day-in and day-out. I'm can't even remember exactly what sparked my interest in coming to Graduate School in the first place.

Well... here I am.
