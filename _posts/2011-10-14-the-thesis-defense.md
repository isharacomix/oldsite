title: The Theis Defense
---

When I started the Ph.D. program two months ago, I had already been to half a dozen qualifying exams, oral preliminaries, and thesis defenses. Because these are such major milestones in a Grad Student's career, I've decided to start going to these early on so that I know what I'm up against when my time comes a few years down the road. I went to another Ph.D. defense today, and since I don't have anything else to talk about (and my blog has recently experienced a serious deficiency of non-cooking related articles), I'll write about that.

There are three types of these exams (which I'll collectively call defenses even though that's not technically accurate): the ones that are taken by people outside of you research group, the ones that are taken by the people *inside* of your research group, and the ones that you take.

Normally, people don't bother going to the defenses of people outside of their group unless they are new to the program or exceptionally bored. Or if they are hungry, because most of the time there is a little snack of cookies and water for folks in the audience. But in most cases, they don't even bother, because the talk is about something outside of their subject matter, they probably don't know the person who is presenting, and they don't care to spend 2 hours of their day listening to someone talk when they could be <del>doing science</del> procrastinating.

On the other hand, most people do (or at least *should*) want to go the defenses of folks who are in the same research group. First of all, if they're in your group, then it means that they have the same advisor as you, and they will probably have a very similar committee to you as well. So it's good to see what kinds of questions they ask, what they look for in a presentation, and prepare in your mind how you want to give your exam when you're up there in the spotlight.

Not to mention, the folks that are in your lab are going to be your friends and colleagues when you go out into the not-so-big world of Science and Research. The folks you know really make a difference when you need to find an expert on a very obscure subject. Being there when your colleagues need some reassurance during the most dreaded two hours of their life goes a long way. Or at least, I'd like to think so. Even if *they* don't appreciate it, the committee will still take notice. They noticed me, after I started appearing for every other exam, after all.

Going to these things is a good way to make a good impression. If it's someone that you don't know, then you'll have a chance to network and meet new people. If it's someone that you do know, you're showing that you're the kind of person that they can count on to be there for them. 

So just go. It may just be another two hours that you could spend writing a paper or reading Slashdot for you, but it means a lot more to them. :)
