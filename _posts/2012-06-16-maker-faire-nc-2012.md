I won't mince words - I was quite disappointed with the turnout at <a href="http://makerfairenc.com/">Maker Faire NC</a> this year.

Last year, there were Makers from wall to wall in the Kerr Scott Building, and the energy was absolutely tremendous. We had Amateur Radio Clubs, Hackerspaces, a Scavenger Hunt... even <a href="http://opensource.com">OpenSource.com</a> had a booth. This year, there was actually room to walk around, which is evidence that there just weren't enough people present. And that made me sad.

This isn't to say I didn't meet some great people or have a good time. I got a chance to talk with a fresh new club at NC State called the <a href="http://ncsu.orgsync.com/org/openhardwaremakerspace/">Open Hardware Makerspace</a>, a quicky-growing student club dedicated to... well... building stuff! I'm particularly interested in them since one of their major focuses are on outreach, and it would be awesome get involved with a student club like that, especially since I'm participating in the <a href="http://stars.csc.ncsu.edu">STARS Student Leadership Corps</a> next year. I don't keep myself busy enough to work on projects with a Makerspace or Hackerspace, but I would love to help out with leading workshops, teaching people how to play with electronics, and showing people how fun working with technology can be! So we'll see how that works.

Speaking of Makerspaces, <a href="http://splatspace.org">Splat Space</a> in Durham also had a booth, and they were showing off this amazing arcade cabinet that they built and filled up with indie games. They took an old arcade cabinet, connected the controls to a keyboard emulator, loaded the games into a PC, and set up a retro CRT monitor to create a very convincing and entertaining arcade stand! It reminded me of my little project to make my own hand-held gaming console one of these days.

Despite the fun, it just couldn't hold a candle to last year. The one thing that remains ingrained in my mind was <a href="http://wyolum.com/">Wyolum's</a> ClockTHREE Jr., a really awesome combination of a word scramble and a clock. They had a pile of creative Open Source Hardware clocks on display, and were really interesting to talk to. I also got to meet the folks at <a href="http://firetowerstudios.com/">FireTower Studios</a>, a local, independent comic book publisher. I was really looking forward to seeing these two groups in particular. I was also hoping the <a href="http://dfma.org">Durham FM Association</a> or the <a href="http://ncocra.org">Orange County Radio Amateurs</a> would be present as well, but sadly, they weren't running a booth either.

The music selection was rather disappointing this time too. Because there was more room, they put the musicians in the same room as the other Makers instead of up in the top floor, so it was much harder to hear them. While there were a few exceptions, most of the music was drone or electronica, and the amazing jazz band that closed out Maker Faire last year didn't show up this time. When I got bored with the booths, I spent the rest of the afternoon listening to the concert, but this time, I just went home.

All in all, it was all right, and it was certainly worth the trip, but it failed to live up to the expectations that Maker Faire 2011 set for me. It was certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience!
