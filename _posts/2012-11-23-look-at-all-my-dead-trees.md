Since coming to Grad School, my collection of books has really taken off. As a card-carrying pack-rat, I refuse to throw anything away that may have some value later down the road. This is sure to be the death of me, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. Most of these books are textbooks from my Undergrad years - either the ones I've bought or the free books given away by professors who are trying to clean out their own collections. The difference between now and then is that I am actively seeking out new books based on recommendations from teachers and friends: I have three books on their way from Amazon right now, two of which I decided to get after they were brought up in a Twitter conversation.

I've always considered a book collection as something that you show off to show your guests (or your students) how educated you are. However, while the bulk of my collection consists of textbooks and technical manuals, I've started getting books that would count as "reading material". Just recently, I finished Dr. Cathy Davidson's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-You-See-Technology-Transform/dp/014312126X">Now You See It</a></em>, and I just started reading Neal Stevenson's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Diamond-Age-Neal-Stephenson/dp/1455884278">The Diamond Age</a></em>. Neither of these books has a glossary or index at the back, which is just one of the many qualities that make them oddballs in my treasure trove.

There's more reading material out there than just research papers and reference manuals. There is much to learn a lot from the qualitative and quantitative studies of my peers, but reading a narrative is not merely a relaxing hobby - it explores new perspectives and introduces creative possibilities that may not even be taken seriously in a laboratory setting. As the saying goes, we as scientists are trained to look at problem under a microscope, but our impact in the world is realized not when we are in our labs, but when the blinders are taken off and we are looking at the rest of the world with what we've learned.

So now that I have them, where am I going to put them? For the longest time, I've kept my books in a stack in my closet, making them nearly impossible to access. It says a lot about me when the first thing on my Christmas list is a bookshelf. When I went back home for Thanksgiving this week, I grabbed an old locker that I used to put all my toys in when I was a kid and brought it back with me to Raleigh to house my collection. I was actually able to migrate the entire collection into its new home - it's not pretty, but it does its job and at least I can <em>see</em> my dead trees now.

Living in a studio apartment, you come to realize the value of "vertical real-estate". Part of what gives you so much room in a single-bedroom apartment or actual house is having distinct rooms, each with walls to align your furniture. In a studio apartment, you don't have many walls, so tall, thin storage units with lots of shelves yield the most storage power per square foot. Now that all of my books have been stored in this locker, hopefully I'll get another locker or bookshelf soon so I can start putting my video games, my DVDs, or my comic books where I can actually get to them.
