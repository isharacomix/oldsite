I finally finished off the rest of my manicottis this weekend. This has been quite a busy weekend for me, since I not only had my paper to write, but I also went for a run with some friends, and also attended my local IEEE section's planning retreat for 2012. Lots of fun to be had, but since this is the weekend, and since the weekend is for discussing my crazy kitchen adventures, we're going to attempt to stay on topic.

This latest cooking experiment has turned out to be one of the best that I've ever pulled off. This time, I tried two different things: firstly, I put broccoli and cauliflower in the ricotta cheese mixture. This was cool not only because it added more vegetable goodness to my diet, but also because the water moistened the cheese a bit, which made it stay soft during the baking process.

Secondly I kept it covered during the baking process, which stopped the noodles from drying out, staying nice and al dente even throughout the baking. When you make lasagna, you cook it in two 30-minute segments. The first where it's covered, so that the steam from the lasagna cooks the dish all the way through without drying it out, and then you cook it uncovered, where it dries out and reaches the firm shape that you expect from lasagna. If you cook it uncovered for too long, the noodles become burnt and generally unpleasant to eat.

So this time, I tried cooking my manicottis covered, and it worked out quite nicely. They kept some of their moisture, and when added to the bed of noodles, turned out to be quite awesome. I've also been trying out some other pasta sauces to see if there are any that I can use as backups, and I've been finding a few that I like. That's good.

I recently saw a post for some <a href="http://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/11/chewy-lemon-cookies/">chewy lemon cookies</a> that I really wanted to try to cook so that I could have brought them to the IEEE get-together today, but my run last night had me coming home too late to go to the grocery store. And then today, I forgot to take the recipe with me when I went shopping, so I still couldn't get all the lemon-stuff that I needed to pull them off. So I got milk and ice cream instead. Sometimes you just need to have a fallback plan, right?

I feel like I'm going around in circles, always cooking pasta, but I can't help it! Pasta is so much fun, and it tastes so good. It just tends to be different combinations of cheese, sauce, and noodles, and to be perfectly honest, I don't mind that one bit. Cheese, sauce, and noodles are among the best things that I think exist in this world.
