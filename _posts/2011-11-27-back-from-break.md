Sorry for the week-long hiatus. I've been busy wrapping up my school year with final projects and exams and whatnot, and Thanksgiving has come and gone as well. Despite all the craziness, I'm still here, I'm still going to get my Ph.D., and I'm still baking cookies. Check it out, fools: chewy lemon cookies.

I found this recipe while browsing one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/11/chewy-lemon-cookies/">How Sweet It Is</a>, in class on a lazy Thursday morning. This marks the third or fourth recipe I've tried out from here, and this one turned out as an overwhelming success. When I try to cook something new every weekend, and she posts a recipe nearly every day, I have no excuse not to cook when Saturday rolls around, whether I'm making an epic pasta dinner or baking a quick snack.

The best part about making baked goods like cookies or muffins is that they are really easy to package up and take to share with your friends. As much as I'm sure my friends would enjoy some of my epic Manicottis, there are a lot of messy logistics involved in safely transporting a temperature-sensitive dish like pasta between two homes. I always take pleasure in making a whole mess of them so that I have plenty to give away to folks.

Also, according to some very reliable sources, apparently being a guy who likes to cook makes me more attractive. Go figure.

This weekend, I tried something new when I baked these cookies - I didn't put any egg in them. For me, eggs are a lot like alcohol - I don't like them by themselves, but there are certain recipes I like that call for them to be used. Unlike alcohol, however, eggs go bad very quickly, and when you make the mistake of cracking open a bad egg... well, it's over. So instead of eggs, I used applesauce, which is apparently a vegan-friendly substitute for eggs in certain situations.

Since eggs play different roles in different recipes, you have to be careful with how you replace them. Since these cookies were lemon flavored, I figured that applesauce would complement the flavor, even though your really aren't supposed to <i>taste</i> it. Other folks suggest bananas instead, which would probably make a good replacement in sugar or chocolate chip cookies. I wasn't sure of how it would work out, but it turned out all right, and the best part is that the cookie dough becomes completely safe to eat without cooking, since there was no raw egg in it! Everybody wins!

Speaking of alcohol, I've discovered a hilarious new cooking show that (in my opinion) is even better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EpicMealTime">Epic Meal Time</a>, and that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/myharto">My Drunk Kitchen</a>, which is exactly what it says it is, and it's even better than it sounds. It reminds me of me except much less nerdy and much more drinking.
