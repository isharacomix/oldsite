title: Sick Doodles
---

Turns out I have strep throat. Hooray. Here's a little picture I drew of the Ishara Comix crew while I was in bed yesterday. I really need to get back into drawing these guys before I lose the little bit of skill I have. Starting from the blob in the top left and going clockwise, we have Gooka, Ooka, Blue, Liana, Ishara, Alexis, and a picture of me, how I look when I've sick.

School starts on Monday. I'll probably be better by then.
