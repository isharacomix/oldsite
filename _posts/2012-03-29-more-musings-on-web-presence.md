Last month, I <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/02/17/whats-up-with-ranking">briefly mentioned my endeavors</a> in trying to make my web presence more pronounced, and I'd like to give an update on my progress thus far, since it looks like my blog is getting a little bit more activity over the past month. Not only has my blog actually moved up to the first page of the Google results, I've been getting quite a bit more readership, thanks to me forming an unholy union with some other social networking websites. So let's talk about how it's worked out for me over the past month.

Recently, I created a <a href="http://twitter.com/isharacomix">Twitter</a> account and connected both my Wordpress blog and my <a href="http://identi.ca/isharacomix">Identi.ca miniblog</a> to it. I'm not really super interested in using Twitter, but since I can post my updates to the Free and Open Source Identi.ca miniblog and have them copied to Twitter, I figured I could leverage the larger community of Twitter while still sitting pretty on the hipster Open Source tool as well. Additionally, I can push my Wordpress updates to Twitter automatically without polluting my miniblog in the sidebar with recursive Wordpress links. And that's always cool.

From there, I linked Twitter to my Facebo... that thing, meaning that when I post on Identi.ca, it goes straight there as well, so I can use an open-source tool to publish to all of the non-Open-Source social networking sites, allowing me to exist in this strange twilight of Open Source publication to closed-down sites. And I'm cool with that. Because Twitter is the linked account, it means all of my FB Friends are able to see my Wordpress updates automatically, and as it turns out... some people actually click on the links.

Each time I publish a new blog entry, about six people visit from FB, while two visit from Twitter. Since none of my WP.com followers are following me on either FB or Twitter, they visit my blog via whatever tool they use on Wordpress, meaning I get a total of about 15 to 20 visits to my blog when a new post is posted.

An interesting anomaly on WP is that when someone is not logged in, every time they view a blog post, it counts as a hit. I noticed several times this month getting 70 views in one day, wondering where they came from, and then I found out that my blog was being checked out by some of the folks in the University Graduate School. While this would <em>should</em> terrify me and make me want to be more conservative with what I post, I prefer to be fascinated by how folks reading my blog spread the word to others, with me being able to track the statistics behind it.

In order to avoid having those kinds of events inflate my visitor counter, I decided to install a <a href="http://flagcounter.com">Flag Counter</a> in my sidebar. Flag Counter allows me to identify individual users who visit my blog, meaning that when someone comes and reads all of my posts, it only counts as a single visitor, which helps me gauge my readership more accurately. It also comes with a fun mini-game, which is trying to collect flags from all around the world... I've currently had visitors from 15 of the United States and from 23 unique countries. While it's not a foolproof analytics package, it gives me enough insight to reasonably guess my general impact.

As for my Search Engine rankings, a search for <em>Barry Peddycord</em> currently puts me:

 * **5th** in Google
 * **2nd** in Bing and Yahoo
 * **3rd** in DuckDuckGo

This is better than it used to be, but still a far from where I would like it. I would have to say that my actual blog is substantially more relevant to someone searching for me than my FB page which is locked down unless you have an account. Oh well, I suppose anyone who is interested in finding me will be able to, especially since I've been handing out such nice business cards with my web presence and avatar on them.

So it's nice to see things growing, here. I've put a lot of love into this blog, so it's nice to see it getting some attention, and I just want to thank the regular readers I have for making it that way! Thanks for putting up with me!
