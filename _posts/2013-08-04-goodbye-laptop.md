title: Good-bye, laptop...
---

The best part about starting a new blog is that I get to write about things that
I had already written about on the last one. This time, I report the very sad
and depressing news that my eight year old laptop - the one I got while I was
still in high school - has finally spun its disks for the last time. Its monitor
had already begun to show signs of aging, and it reached the point where it
started freezing while trying to run, so I decided to call it a day, take what
I could salvage out of it, and put it away for the last time. I had just bought
new RAM for it about a year ago, so I was hoping to get at least a year out of
it, and I'm glad I did.

You can't go wrong by having a computer disaster recovery plan. My goal is to be
able to go from a computer failure to productivity in less than two hours, and
for the past three years, I've had three failures and managed to make that time
limit. Sometimes the computer OS crashes and just needs a fresh install, but
there's always the possibility that the hardware will die and the error will be
irrecoverable. I have three computers, all running the exact same configuration
of software ([Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org) Long-Term Service), where the only
differences between them are the desktop wallpapers. I've also added a
Raspberry Pi to the family, so I have no idea what I'm going to do with that!

All of my files are stored in [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29)
repositories - some on [Github](http://github.com), others on a private server.
The cool thing about Git repositories is that they are, by nature, decentralized.
This means that if any of my machines goes down - including Github or my server -
I can turn any other into the control machine. While I have to manually pull my
changes each time I log in, that's perfectly fine, since - for the most part -
I've got enough of the code saved on each machine that even if I lose something,
I don't lose enough to set me back.

While I don't agree with putting everything in the cloud, having things in
multiple physical locations helps against data loss, and also makes it easier
to bring data to a newly installed machine. I can't afford to spend my time
configuring machines, so I focus more on keeping information in places where
it's easy to reach.

What about you? Do you have a failure plan?
