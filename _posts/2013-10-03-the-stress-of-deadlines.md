title: The Stress of Deadlines

From what I can tell, grad school is basically a trial of stress management.
Research, teaching, classwork, papers, dissertation... dealing with the stressors
of academic life combined with the stressors of actual life, it's easy to
constantly feel in a state of anxiety that keeps your lungs feeling like you're
halfway underwater. While it's tempting to tell myself to work through it and
tempting to fail to accomplish that and succumb to lethargy, I think the actual
most productive thing to do is piece out exactly where the stress is coming
from and figure it out.

As a computer scientist, my superpower is problem reduction. I take a big level
20 problem that is scary and break it into lots of non-threatening level 1 problems
that are easy to solve. It's not long until I've reduced the problem to nothing
and relax as I feast on the flesh of the problems that once stood in my path to
glory.

So today, I've discovered that at least one of the major stress-factors associated
with academia is the idea of arbitrary, important deadlines. Every time you look
up, there's another conference coming up that is totally related to your research.
If you're like me, you've got tons of great projects in the ideas phase that you
still have yet to actually bootstrap because you're waiting on your data or your
approval from the IRB. Nobody outside of your lab will seriously listen to your
ideas since you don't have any data or studies to back it up, and talk is cheap
since unfunded studies have a way of never leaving the ideas phase (and in the
process, leaving the poor grad student dreaming of greatness without a degree
to show for it).

As a result, nearly ever conference that crops up ends up on my TODO list,
each with a deadline somewhere one week to one month from now, even when there
is absolutely no chance of even trying to get into the conference, let alone
meeting the deadline to do so. This means that even things that I will *never*
do end up on my TODO list, serving to do nothing except demotivate me. Missing
a conference deadline means I'm running behind the crowd, and when I'm already
dealing with stuff like imposter syndrome, I really don't need that sort of
message reinforced at the top of my TODO list every day.

The deadlines tell me that there are things I should be doing that aren't the
things I want to be doing, and that stops me from doing the things that keep
me happy and excited about academia. There are lots of things I love to do -
reading papers, talking with other academics, writing about research on my
blog. I even like writing papers, but the looming threat of deadlines ruin all
of the fun.

Part of figuring out how to deal with stress is identifying where it's coming
from, and already I feel better knowing why I feel awful (or at the very least,
finding a scapegoat upon which to blame my bad mood). Knowing is half the battle,
so here's hoping tomorrow I'm able to get out of my slump and take the bull by
the horns.
