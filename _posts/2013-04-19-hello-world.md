title: Hello World
---

Hello, world! Welcome to my new blog, powered by the magic of
[GitHub pages](pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
This marks the second time I've switched blogging platforms this year, but I
think I like this best of all, even if the website looks terribly hideous at the
moment.

In February, I left my [Wordpress](http://isharacomix.wordpress.com) blog after
two years of writing. It was a hard move, since I started that blog on the very
first day of Graduate school. Things were crazy back then, since I didn't really
know what I wanted to do at the time. The blog served as an artifact to help me
develop my identity as a scholar. After finding a research direction, an
advisor, and figuring out what I wanted to do for my dissertation, I didn't 
really need *that* blog any more. That blog was personal, it was *for me*. Now
I need to develop a blog *for the world* that's *about me*... and most importantly...
*about my research*.

After packing things up, I decided to try [Tumblr](http://isharacomix.tumblr.com)
for a change of scenery. I have to say, I really love the Tumblr ethos. The 
culture of asking and reblogging is something that I really wanted to be able
to participate in, and following blogs in a centralized dashboard made reading
much more enjoyable than trying to read through posts in Google Reader (which
is slated to be discontinued this summer, to my great disappointment). It was lots
of fun, but when I realized that my blog was full of *Les Miserables* animated
GIFs, I started to think that maybe I didn't exactly want the first impression
of folks who find me online to be that... informal. :)

So now I've set up a Github website, which is awesome for a number of reasons.
First of all, I feel like if I'm not using all of the functionality of a system
I use, then I'm wasting it. This is an extremely bad habit of mine, but in this
case, I've managed to justify it. I always preach about being open and about the
Github and forking model of developing code to be the best thing in the world,
yet I haven't done any of my work in the open until I started working on
[#8bitmooc](http://8bitmooc.org). By putting my website on Github, this will
encourage me to be in the Github environment more often, and (optimistically)
my productivity will improve.

But wait - there's more! As someone who dreams about becoming a professor one day
in the future, part of that dream involves me building my very own research lab
full of Grad Student minions. For the longest time, I've always struggled trying
to think of how to maintain an online presence for a research lab. While I was
originally thinking a Wiki would be a good idea, it makes much more sense to
just do our work and maintain our image in the same environment: Github! By
setting up a Github organization for my future research lab, it would be
possible to maintain project repositories, set up an internal research wiki,
assign tasks via the issue tracker, and keep a lab blog. The ideal work
environment allows us to manage our internal and external workflows with minimal
overhead, and whether I decide to be a Computer Science or Digital Humanities
professor, Git (or whatever version control happens to exist ten years from now)
will be a required literacy for all of my future students.

However, that's a bit down the road. For now, I've set up two new Github projects
to maintain my [Teaching](http://teaching.isharacomix.org) and
[Researc](http://research.isharacomix.org) portfolios. The especially cool part
about having a teaching portfolio in Github is that the website serves as a
polished presentation format for the portfolio, but has the option to download
the complete portfolio (maintained in its project repository) as an archive.
My old teaching portfolio was hosted on my Wordpress site, but I feel like
moving it to Github would not only be more efficient, but would be an excellent
way to make mine stand out from others.

So here's to a long, productive life with Github. Now to do something about this
ugly bootstrap theme.
