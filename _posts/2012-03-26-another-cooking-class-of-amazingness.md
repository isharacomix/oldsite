I was supposed to write this post after my cooking class on Saturday, but since I was up against a few project and paper deadlines, I pushed it back to today - I may love cooking, and I may love writing my blog, but the first and foremost thing in my mind is my Ph.D., and I have to keep my priorities in order. Cooking is just a creative and emotional outlet for me, since no matter what gets me down, I can cheer myself back up with cooking. So let's talk about what we made this time!

Once again, we joined the wonderful cook and teacher Claire to learn how to prepare <a href="http://deliziedelizie.com/2012/03/26/easter-meal-seared-to-perfection-lamb-chops-with-herbed-butter-green-beens-almondine-and-thyme-potatoes-sautees/">a delicious French Easter meal</a>. Maybe it's a European thing, because my family's never had lamb for Easter... in fact, my family's never had lamb period, so it was an interesting new meat for me. The meat itself was nothing super-special - a little salt, a little pepper, a little garlic - but what really made it stand out on the plate was the garlic butter that we topped it off with. That helped make it moist and flavorful, and I remember them doing the same thing at the fancy meal I had back during the Trusted Infrastructure Workshop at Carnegie-Mellon. If anything, the idea of a garlic butter is something I want to try on more meals.

The potatoes and green beans made excellent side-dishes, but the most unique part of the plate was the mango salsa. I'll be honest, "fruit" salsas have never really been my thing. But this wasn't the tomato-based, saucy-salsa that you get at the grocery store, it was a more coarse salsa, which I'm not quite sure how to describe. It was very good, and I ended up enjoying the flavor when eaten with the potatoes more than anything else. I certainly wouldn't try to sit down with tortilla chips for a salsa like this, but it honestly tasted very well standing on its own, because it was so heavily mango-based.

All in all, dinner was great, but we can't wrap up without talking about the dessert. The first thing we did when we arrived was start preparing the tartlets for the oven. We chopped up some strawberries and filled the crusts with some custard. It was a very mild dessert - I'm used to having desserts that are super-sweet and overpowering, so this was a nice change of pace, though I would have preferred to have a little ice cream alongside it. I like my desserts cold, if not icy. Maybe that's just because of the recent weather shifts that have made North Carolina so hot these past few days.

Once again, the class was great, and it was a great way for me to experiment cooking with different things since I'm not worried about the ingredients going bad (they aren't my problem in this case!). While many of the ingredients had to be pre-prepared before the class started (the potatoes were already boiled, the garlic butter was already whipped), that's unavoidable. We can only get together for a few hours, and a non-trivial meal will have a few elements that have to be prepared for at least a half a day (marinating, letting things chill or warm up, etc). That aside, I learned quite a lot and was happy to be a part of the class!
