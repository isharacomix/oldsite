title: The Flavors of Blogs

This summer has been ridiculously busy, and unfortunately I haven't had the
opportunity to blog, either here or in my blog for *Playing with Wire*. The blog
inactivity guilt threshold has reached a fever pitch so that means it's time for
me to blog about what I think about blogs and how they work with me.

In my work, the kinds of blogs I've started fallen into one of three categories:
personal, project, and research. Each blog has its own feel and its own expectations,
not only from the point of view of a reader, but from that of a writer as well.
In a personal blog, for example, off-topic streams of consciousness are appropriate
and par for the course, since the blog is mostly written as a way of letting off
steam. In project blogs, that sort activity is confusing and frowned upon, and
posts look more like press releases than the inner workings of a teenager's diary.
Research blogs, something that as a Ph.D. student I should care much more deeply
about, are interesting in that they fall in the middle: while often very newsy and
presenting carefully crafted research, they can just as legitimately feature
*on-topic* streams of consciousness that let the audience get a glimpse into the mind
of the researcher.

I think I have too many blogs, and I'm even sort of regretting starting up a whole
platform around *Playing with Wire* since I simply have not had the time to work on
any projects beyond a simple "Hello World" blinking LED. I originally started the
project to be a stress-reliever, but I've got this dreadful habit of turning what
should be relaxing into another full-time thing on my mind. I do that to myself a
lot. And typically the warning sign that something is about to get out of hand is
when I decide to give it its own project blog. I can't even begin to comprehend what
manner of sadistic forces keep compelling me to do this to myself and to my projects,
but the pattern comes up year after year.

The ultimate dream always looks the same: getting a job as a professor, running a lab
group, and having an awesome research blog that pushes the envelope for openness in
science. I'm not sure why that image sticks in my head, and it's definitely a case of
putting the cart before the horse, but the one thing I care the most about is that I
want my research to be approachable to the public. So even from this point of view, I'm
trying to figure out what it would look like and how it would be managed. I'm trying to
put it into practice myself, which requires a lot more introspection than I've had to
do in the past. I've had to carefully examine how I think, how I come up with ideas, and
how I turn ideas into results. This forced attempt at metacognition is taxing and
stressful, and I can say that I'm not having much success with it.

I keep wondering if I should delete my blog, but it's almost like my blog is the last
place I turn to whenever I've dealt with a problem for so long I just have to articulate
it and let it out. And for whatever reason, I feel content to let it out to the public
on my blog rather than keeping it relegated to my private journal. I don't know what
compels me to do things this way, meaning that there's still more introspection to be
done. Maybe the personal blog still serves a purpose, or maybe there's just a terror of
doing away with the only consistent factor I've had in my grad school career since it
started.
