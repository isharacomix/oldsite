title: Beyond the Discipline

This evening, I had the pleasure of going to not one, but <em>two</em> IEEE events this evening. The first, was a highly technical meeting on disaster recovery, hosted by our Computer Society Chapter, while the second was a decidedly non-technical meeting with our PACE Chapter on how the hiring process works from an HR point of view. Can you guess which one I enjoyed more?

The second one. And I promise it had nothing to do with the fact that the air conditioning was broken on the hottest day of the year.

[PACE](http://ieeeusa.org/volunteers/pace/default.asp), which stands for <strong>Professional Activities Committees for Engineers</strong>, is an interesting entity when it comes to the IEEE. Unlike the technical societies, PACE concerns itself with non-technical subjects that are part of everyday life for Engineers, such as human issues (interviewing, social networking) and policy issues (copyright, licensure). In our company was a mix of highly technical engineers as well as HR individuals for engineering industries, and the fact of the matter is, many engineers simply don't think of their skills anywhere beyond the technical matters.

I know from my experiences as an Undergrad (and even in Grad School) my very technical colleagues simply don't put any effort into what are called "soft skills". They measure their performance based on their aptitude in hte discipline without realizing that their communication, interviewing, and image-management skills are just as important as their list of publications and latin honors. Even though this is a big issue, literature from <a href="http://asee.org">ASEE</a> conferences repeats again and again that Universities do not foster and develop these skills effectively. As a result, we produce engineers who are inflexible, myopic, and woefully unprepared for the first time they have an interview. The only students who are prepared for such things are those who go beyond the curriculum, which shows enough initiative on their part that they're probably destined for success anyway.

NC State's Undergraduate Computer Science program features several courses on "Software Engineering", which is the "professional" side of programming. Taking a Software Engineering course is more like taking an English course than a Computer Science course... granted, it's an English course with a lot more Java, but even so, very little time is spent coding. Most of it is spent reading code, going over specs, arguing with customers who have no idea what they want, and getting the sinking feeling that the TA and Professor you thought you could trust are actively trying to sabotage your work.

Just like in real life.

What they're trying to make clear to you is that even though you're taking programming classes, and even though you're becoming an engineer, you are worthless unless you can <em>communicate</em>. Gone are the days of hiring the scruffy, meritocratic hacker who can't be let out in polite company. These "soft skills" are essential, and many folks don't realize it until they reach the point in their career when someone sees all of their technical expertise, shrugs their shoulders and says "so what?" Soft skills go from communication skills to being able to identify how to adapt your technical expertise to problems in other domains. Soft skills include flexibility and preparation for lifelong learning.

I've always been enamored with these soft, non-technical aspects of the discipline that I love, which is why I knew from day one in my Graduate Studies that I wanted to take a sociological spin on my research. We left today's talk after putting a lot of exciting new ideas on the table - I can't wait to see what PACE comes up with next.
