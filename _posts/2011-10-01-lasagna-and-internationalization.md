title: Lasagna and Internationalization
---

We need some smart computer scientists out there to develop the *.wif* file format, a binary encoding for aromas, odors, and other smells. If I had a device that could record and share *.wif* formats, then I'd totally upload a copy of the lasagna's. Of course, we need to make sure this format uses the Ogg container so that it would be Free and interoperable.

This time I actually have two things to talk about. But since this picture is about lasagna, I'll start with that. I fixed the lasagna in a pretty vanilla way. I made three layers of noodles, each with a layer of ricotta, swiss, parmesan, and romano-flavored pasta sauce. And boy, it was good. Granted, I think I went a bit overboard with the cheese, since it seemed to overpower the sauce. But in spite of that, it was still an unbelievably amazing dish.

The hardest part about this meal was getting it out of the pan (shown here) and onto my plate (not shown). Lasagna is, in theory, supposed to come out of the pan in cute little cubes that preserve the layers of the dish (kind of like a stable sorting algorithm). In my case, however, I kind of just took whatever would come out of the pan and put it on my plate, resulting in a cheesy blob of sauce and noodles (or a saucy blob of cheese and noodles, depending on your point of view).

The best part was that I tried out lining the pan with foil, which made cleanup such a breeze! Unlike frying chicken and vegetables, which requires all sorts of effort to clean off, the messy foil just lifted right out of the pan taking the burnt cheese and noodles with it. I'm sure that doing this is an ISO standard practice, but I still thought it was a pretty swell idea.

In other news, today I went to the [International Festival of Raleigh](http://www.internationalfestival.org/) with a friend of mine, and we browsed around for a while. There were all sorts of stands selling various goodies and foods relating to the cultures of the vendors: the Russians were selling Christmas ornaments, the Chinese were selling rice, and the Japanese were selling Gundam model kits. Always a pleasure to see such a diverse crowd of people. I was kind of disappointed in that while a broad group of cultures were being represented, there wasn't a single booth for Indonesia, which I was actually looking forward to seeing when I went over.

They also had a live cooking session where there was a kitchen and they showed you how to make various dishes. Too bad we arrived in between two of those sessions. Ah well, at least we tried, right?
