This weekend, I did something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I bought some chicken and cooked it myself. And I don't mean TV-Dinner chicken... I bought some actual raw chicken meat and fried it in the grease myself. You know... the way nature intended.

It was an enlightening experience. The first night, I made the mistake of putting too much oil in my little frying pan, and the chunk of chicken was too big to fit in it. There was hot grease splattering everywhere, the smoke alarm kept going off, all my dishes were dirty... it was exhausting. The chicken turned out wonderfully, even if I did have a heck of a mess to clean up afterwards, though it was a little bland, since I didn't put any pepper or anything into the breading. Then again, I made it into a chicken parmesan dish in the end, so the marinara gave it plenty of flavor of its own. I faced certain death and still managed to have a delicious dinner, so I'd call that night a success.

Since there were still two more chicken breasts in the pack, I had to fix them again a second night. This time, I knew what to expect. I cut the chicken into strips so that I could use less oil at a lower heat, and that really ended up working out for the best: the mess was totally kept under control this time. When I prepared the flour, I put chili powder and garlic and all sorts of fun spices in it, though I really wish I would have bought some saltines to break up and use as breading like my mom does. That usually turns out really good. At any rate, this time it took a little longer since I only cooked about a half of a breast at a time, but it still turned out awesome. Once again, I fixed a chicken parmesan dinner, and once again, it was wonderful.

As much fun as cooking was, and as rewarding of an experience it was, I can't say that I can justify all of the mess I had to clean up just for one plate of dinner. If I was cooking for more than just me, then I'd be totally willing to go through all of the effort and preparation and cleanup that it takes, but first I exhaust myself making it, then I eat it in like twenty minutes, and then I get up and clean the mess (and grease is really unpleasant to clean). If I was cooking for someone else, then the company and the appreciation would offset the effort.

So everything worked out OK. The apartment didn't burn down. I'm still alive. All's well that ends well. I think I wanna give lasagna a shot next time~
