And just like that, the first month of the year is gone. I've been through three weeks of classes so far, while slowly molding my paper into the next big contribution to Computer Science. I'm obviously going to rock the foundations of the discipline with this work. I'll even be making a poster and showing off all of my amazing science to the rest of the University at our Graduate Research Symposium.

My good friend <a href="http://fionaa-chan.deviantart.com">Fionaa-chan</a> produced a lovely new banner for my site, which you can see at the top of the page. It's the first female grad for a banner thus far, and I hope to see more diversity in our grads as time goes on. Once again, <a href="http://ihara.deviantart.com">my brother</a> took care of the bannerification, so that's cool. As it turns out, they don't have this kind of graduation in France, which is disappointing, because everyone should have a chance to put on this awesome outfit. I loved it so much I want to do it <i>again</i>!

But I digress. As it turns out, classes are being particularly abusive this semester - there's nothing conceptually difficult about the material I'm learning, but there's a lot of work to be done this time, and it's making me rethink my attitude towards research credits. After all, I'm already a student in good standing with the University, so I have no pressure to take any additional courses. Once I get all of my core classes out of the way, I'm nearly done. All I have to do from there is take all of the security and analytics-related courses offered by the department, and then classes are done.

I don't even think I'll pursue the minor in teaching I was thinking of - there are other avenues that are more profitable and don't take nearly as much time away from my research. I'd get more out of standing up and actually teaching a class than I would from sitting and getting taught on how to teach. Especially since I can go to these free teaching workshops for no-pressure, high-reward sessions.

The University offers plenty of resources for folks who want to get into teaching without having to enroll in the College of Education, so I'll take advantage of those. Preparing the Professoriate, the Certificate of Accomplishment in Teaching, the Teaching Practicum... the list goes on. There's no shortage of transcript notations that I can claim for my CV to prove to University hiring departments that I will strive for excellence in both teaching <i>and</i> in research.

So that was a rambling mess of a blog entry. Now I'm hungry. What's for dinner?
