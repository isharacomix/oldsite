I've not been blogging very often since I've been writing a lot of papers this
past month. I submitted a paper to ITS and EDM, and the paper at ITS was
accepted as a short paper! It feels really good to be back in the game after so
much time without any publications. I'm not happy with the exploratory nature of
some of the papers we've submitted, but now we've made it to the point where I
think we can do some more controlled, concrete research.

Doing research with human subjects is messy, and I really got myself in trouble
by deciding to abandon the world of AI and simulation to do research on
"learning". Research involving human subjects is slow because you need a lot of
people and a lot of time to get enough data to make sure your research is
transferable. If you mess up a study, it takes a lot of time to bring enough
people together to do another one, and by then, you've had enough delays to miss
the conference paper deadline. I think I've already written about my feelings on
the deadline culture in Computer Science research, but not only do I think it
pressures scholars unnecessarily, I think it doesn't work well for the unique
kind of research we do in Computer Science Education that doesn't fit timetables
very well.

With that complaining out of the way, let's talk about the good things happening
in life!

I've been collecting a lot of very interesting data lately from a course on
"The Beauty and Joy of Computing", taught to a cohort of primarily non-major
students. We've been able to get a delicious corpus of data from students
attempting lab exercises using the [Snap][] programming language. I'm very
interested in developing a technique for doing analysis on these programs,
showing how the parse tree of their programs change as they complete assignments.
Even though I hate the XML data format, I think it'll be a very fun exercise to
develop a technique for studying and visualizing Snap code as a graph. I need
a way to visualize student performance in order to do any meaningful research,
and these will be the first steps to that end.

The problem with this work is that, once again, it is highly exploratory, and
there is a lot of hate for post-hoc analysis. On the other hand, it's much easier
to come up with hypotheses by looking at data and then come up with a better
experiment that allows us to test our suspicions in a more controlled setting.
There's a lot of delayed gratification in educational research, especially if
you're doing work in the classroom and dealing with turnaround times of up to a
semester.

I'm hoping to blog more about my actual research, but I'm just not doing much
these days. Teaching takes up a lot of time, but I'm going to make sure I don't
slack off this semester and let my students down. This week, I'll start playing
with the data and see if I can come up with anything fun and amazing!
