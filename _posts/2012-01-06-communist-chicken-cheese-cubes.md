title: Communist Chicken Cheese Cubes

Despite being sick, I still managed to do some epic cooking this week. On Tuesday, I revisited my <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2011/10/16/bourbon-blogs-and-bitter-roommates">sweet bourbon glaze</a> that I used on salmon, but this time, putting it on some chicken. When I had chicken left over, I wanted to think of something different to do with it, and I decided to try something from <a href="https://vandersg.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/buffalo-chicken-bites/">Time Well Wasted</a> - her "Buffalo Chicken Bites" recipe.

So the adventure started by finding out how to make dough. As it turns out, I happen to be an idiot, because I completely forgot that the thing that makes bread different from cookies and cakes is a little thing called yeast. So I headed to the grocery store to find some, and I swear, I walked past it about ten times before I figured out where they were. Apparently, yeast is sold in single-serving packets rather than in big bags like flour, so I had my eyes out on the wrong thing, it seems. I was about to do a "from-scratch" recipe I found online to make my dough, but I bumped into some "pizza yeast", which turned out to be just the thing I needed for this recipe.

This was my first time making a bread dough, so I was surprised by the amount of flour I had to use with it. The kneading process was new to me, but eventually, I figured out how it worked (and why you need to keep your hands floured to make it work!). While my chicken baked, I kneaded the heck out of that dough, shredded some swiss cheese, and got all of my hot sauce out.

Basically, to make each blob, I pinched off a bit of dough, rolled it into a ball, and flatted it into a mini-pizza on a cookie sheet (covered in tin-foil... my hero). Then I put some sauce and cheese on the dough, a chunk of chicken, and attempted to wrap the dough back around the chicken, pinching it at the top. It was interesting how the hot sauce moistened the dough just enough to make it impossible to work with, so each ball was made very frantically until all of the chicken was hidden from sight. Then I just popped them all in the oven and let them cook at 425&deg;F for about 20 minutes.

In the end, they were disappointingly mild and a bit salty. The dough absorbed the hot sauce, so I had to add extra sauce to the finished product (which I would have done anyway, but it was the principle of the matter). Additionally, they were VERY doughy, and I would have preferred something more like a "thin and crispy" envelope for each chicken chunk. Instead, they ended up being more like crispy dinner rolls with a cheesy chicken core. Not that they weren't good, they just weren't what I was expecting.

In the end, I learned a few new things from this adventure, from how to make good oven-baked chicken to how to make bread from scratch! What will I do next? No idea. Probably take a nap.
