I'm currently wrapping up my final project for my English 890 course at Duke
University on 21st Century Digital Literacies. This course has been tremendously
interesting, and one of the reasons why is that we are collaboratively writing
an e-book together to talk about what this class was all about. While I could
write any number of things about this course, I'd actually like to talk about
something I discovered during the writing process of this chapter.

In English classes, they always taught us that a "proper" paper begins by
introducing a thesis, and then goes on to explain and justify it. Every piece
of writing should come with a main point, and that's something that can be
seen in the way I blog. I generally have something I'm trying to convey, and
I usually get to it within 500-800 words. However, this isn't the way I always
wrote. Sometimes I only had a vague idea about what I wanted to discuss, and
then started writing in the hopes that something more profound would arrive
while I put words on the screen.

The Duke class was an experiment. An experiment for me taking something
completely outside of my comfort zone, working in a class with no clear
expectations of what would be done, and pushing me to write in a medium
I've never taken part in. I had no idea what to write for this chapter. So
my colleague [Elizabeth](http://twitter.com/eapitts) and I started writing
with the idea that maybe something would emerge from it.

This style of writing is very much like writing a diary entry, where the creation
of the artifact is done for the purpose of focusing the thoughts in the author's
mind and expressing what he or she is trying to say. The prose forces the author
to linearize the decidedly non-linear structure of the mind, since forcing this
realignment has the side effect of making one think consciously about the thoughts
in the back of the head. This allows old ideas to be refreshed, mixed with newer
ones, and left to simmer again.

The thesis then comes at the end, as though I finally figured out what on earth
I was trying to say. The reader becomes a guest as they take that ride - learning
as much about me as they do about the topic I'm writing about. In a blog, this is
the perfect way to write, since the subject of the blog that I am trying to convey
through my work is *me*.
