Where to begin?

Today was awesome. Rather than getting any work done, I hopped in my car and drove to Duke University in Durham, NC to visit the first meeting of the <a href="http://sites.fhi.duke.edu/phdlab/">Ph.D. Lab in Digital Learning</a>. This was a part of the "Wednesdays at the Center" program where they have public talks around research designed to engage the community in what's going on up in the Ivory Towers.

The theme was on assessment, focusing somewhat on <a href="https://rubric.e-education.psu.edu/open/">a tool</a> developed by some brilliant folks from Penn State University that allows teachers to develop rubrics for online grading and share them with their colleagues in order to work together to make them the best rubrics they can be. Rubrics were a major theme today, as they are the only way to assign some sense of formality to the grading of authentic assessments such as essays and portfolios, yet they are usually made very badly.

While this tool may seem limited, this actually relates to something I've been advocating for the longest time: a departure from "kitchen sink" Learning Management Systems like Moodle and the arrival of single-purpose educational apps do one job really well is naturally the way that things are going. Mobile computing is the prime example of this - educational software needs to get with the times. The only organizations that benefit from monolithic learning management systems are the companies that successfully lock institutions into them... because it's no surprise that stubborn University professors are among the crowd most resistant to changes to their workflow.

However, the conversation went far beyond this app... ironically enough, it went the farthest when we went to the workshop where we were supposed to be playing with the app in the first place. In the true spirit of an academic reading group, we began to discuss and challenge established notions of assessments, citing the words of those that published before us, and it was a beautiful sight to see - you don't see these discussions in Computer Science research labs. This is the kind of energy I hope I'll get from the Reading Group I'm leading this semester, because this is what academia is all about and why I decided to spend the next four to eight years pursuing a Graduate degree.

The Duke Ph.D. Lab, which I heard about from the <a href="http://hastac.org">HASTAC</a> community, is an interdisciplinary group of graduate students who are focused on technology as applied to learning. I didn't note a single Computer Scientist in the room, yet <em>they understand the magnitude of the impact of technology on society</em> far beyond any of the "Computer Scientists" I interact with on a daily basis. They think beyond the technology itself and see its applications in the big picture. This is the reason why I encourage my colleagues to get out of the lab and <em>meet the people who would have something to say about the work they do</em>. The introduction of computers into society has changed every corner of the world, and these folks have the mindset to direct that change to the greater good. It's not about the computers... it's how they're being used and the people using that makes the difference.

The overall message, and the reason why this subject was chosen to kick off the Ph.D. Lab, is because assessment is the most important part behind any course, research agenda, or project. If it can't be measured, it can't be improved, and research is all about gradual, <em>measurable</em> improvement. By outlining a definition of success, you begin whatever initiative you're starting on the right foot: when you know how victory is going to be measured, you know how to make decisions and take actions that are going to steer your project in that direction.

This was a great way to spend an afternoon, and I feel sorry for all the colleagues of mine who didn't join me in the carpool to visit. You guys really missed out on something fantastic.
