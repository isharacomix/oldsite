All work and no play makes Barry lose his mind and adversely affects his
physical health. I've been so ridiculously stressed out this month, and
everything about my life has been off-rhythm. The fact that I sit in the lab
and stare at my computer expecting work to magically happen is particularly
a bad idea, and makes me dig deep into my heart so that I can ask myself what
I want to do.

I'm the kind of person who can't just have fun unless I'm intentionally trying
to have fun. If fun happens when I'm not intending it, it means it's happening
instead of working, which makes me a terrible person. Grad school guilt is an
extremely destructive state of mind, but I've had this sort of attitude for as
long as I can remember, and I can remember a time before I was in grad school.

As I alluded to in a
[previous blog post](http://isharacomix.org/2013/09/29/progression-in-games),
I like to have something to show for everything I do. Part of why I love
research is that after all of the work is said and done, a beautiful,
quantifiable piece of writing is produced and shared with the world. All of
this writing together creates an anthology of the trail I have cut through
the unknown and is the signature of my work in this world - consistent and
concise.

So this means that in most cases, I feel as though I can't justify playing
games by myself. At least when I play board games with other people, I am
creating experiences with friends and establishing social ties. However, by
myself, when all is said and done, I am simply killing time. I might be
participating in a story and flexing creativity muscles, or I might be engaged
in battles of strategy and working my problem-solving skills. However, both
of these require me to be able to immerse myself in another world, which doesn't
leave much for this world to show for it (achievements and high scores don't
count).

Pretty much everyone who gets interested in programming go that way from a
desire to make video games, and I was no different. While I certainly have no
desire to make games professionally, teaching has opened my mind to looking at
video games as situated learning experiences, which completely changes my
perspective on how I engage with them. As such, I've developed a renewed interest
in making a game, but still haven't tapped into it. For one reason, no big game
I've ever started on has ever been finished. There isn't much satisfaction in
making little tiny games for me. I want a project - I want to overengineer it
because I think that's fun!

On the other hand, sometimes it's really hard to stick to a schedule. I either
work on it all day one weekend and burn myself out, or I don't work on it for
several days and lose track of where I was when I pick it back up. Neither of
these are particularly optimal, so I wasn't really sure what to do. But then I
got this great idea while browsing the [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com)
forums... what if I livestreamed and recorded my programming? Instead of a 
*Let's Play*, something like a *Let's Make*?

There is value in this project. First of all, the idea would be to stream live
on a regular schedule, something like an hour a night. If I use Google Hangouts,
which works very well on my computer, I can stream live to Youtube and then
record the session directly to my horribly underutilized channel. The videos
can serve as a sort of creative outlet in a way this blog doesn't, as well as
being a free educational resource to anyone interested in learning a programming
language.

So the idea is this: when I get back from my vacation next week, I'm thinking
about doing a *Let's Make a [Roguelike](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org)*
on my [Youtube Channel](http://youtube.com/IsharaComixVideos). Rather than
recording and doing post-recording cleanup, I plan to do it live in one cut using
a Google Hangout so that folks can stream my coding as it happens and watch it on
Youtube after it's over. Since I'll limit myself to an hour of coding each day,
each day can be focused on a specific task, and I basically think aloud as I
solve the task.

One of the biggest challenges with this particular plan is that I have to make my
terminal, text editor, and browser pretty zoomed in so that folks watching the
videos at average quality can actually keep up with what is being typed. Even if
they can't, each day's changes will be pushed to a public Github repository so
that folks can look over the changes and see what happens each day.

... you know, I've always hated recording myself because I despise the sound of
my voice, but a lot of that is the discomfort of hearing ourselves talk. It
doesn't sound like we think we sound, so it can be kind of unsettling. The best
way to make yourself sound good is to talk slowly, open and close your mouth
completely, and don't put your face right on the microphone. It takes some
getting used to, but I think I'd be happy with doing something like this to take
my mind off the monotony of my daily work.
