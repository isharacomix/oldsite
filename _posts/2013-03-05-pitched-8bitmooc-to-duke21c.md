title: Pitched 8bitmooc to duke21c
---

Today I pitched the #8bitmooc project to my #duke21c class and - for the most part - it went over well. Nobody thought it was a *terrible* idea, and most of the questions that were asked were for elucidation and not to instill criticism. For a business pitch, it went well, since I managed to cover the highlights of the project without getting too technical. I brought up what really mattered:

 * The personalized learning afforded by the video-game-esque interface
 * The motivation to help ones peers by responding to SOS calls
 * The potential for students to think meta-cognitively by developing challenges for their classmates
 * The nonlinear exploration of a wiki-based textbook

That being said, I really hope that its reception was on the merits of the project and not just because of the "OMG I'm a Computer Scientist programmer and so creative" factor.

I like to joke that part of what I like doing interdisciplinary work is that when I'm around the Humanists I can play up the Computer Science, and when I'm around the Computer Scientists I can play up the Humanities so that I'm always the expert in the room. In reality, this mindset terrifies me. since it means I'm not vulnerable to the same kind of rigorous critique I'll need in order to meet the merit of what's considered Doctoral workâ€¦ constantly getting approval from my peers sets unrealistic expectations of the world, and will come back to bite me years down the road.

This is why I'm working so hard to build a Dissertation Committee with some of the hardest and most critical professors in the department. I don't want an easy Ph.D. You only get as much out of a graduate degree as you put into it, meaning that unless I make my Ph.D. as challenging as I can, it's not going to prepare me for when the stakes get higher and I start going for academic, tenure-track positions.
