Today was the day of my exams. There were two of them, one for Algorithms, the other for Internet Protocols.

I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I didn't struggle on them, meaning I either had the ideas under control, or I was totally clueless. We'll find out which of those is the case by the end of the week, when my grades come in.

Not much else to say other than that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUku7zAXVE">Here's a sneak peek</a> of what I'll be cooking this weekend to celebrate Christmas-time.
