title: The Roadmap

So the first week of classes have come to an end! I'm in an interesting situation where I have my main classes on Tuesday and Thursday, leaving Monday, Wednesday, and most of Friday open for research and homeworks. It might be challenging to cram all that lecturing into a 24-hour block, but I think I'll be able to strike a happy balance between my research and coursework commitments while still managing to save a few moments for myself.

In my department, it's considered unusual for a first-semester Ph.D. student to serve as a Research Assistant. Since the first semester typically features a full course load of 9 credit hours (along with the adjustment to Graduate-level work), they usually expect us to work as Teaching Assistants instead. That pressures us with slightly less responsibilities as well as giving us an opportunity to find potential advisors.

However, I've already acclimated to the research culture to a certain degree since I kicked off my research career as soon as I got my B.Sc. I even went to an [academic workshop](http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/tiw/) before I officially began my studies, so I think I'm starting off on the right foot. I'm lucky that I have a professor who's willing to give me the responsibilities I need to prove that I'm serious and committed to the career I've picked.

Anyway... like I said... first week of classes are now over, and I'm happy with the courses I've signed up for. As far as coursework goes, Ph.D. students in my department are required to take six core courses, four at the 500 introductory level (two in theory and two in systems), and then two at the 700 level. Right now, I'm taking my two theory courses in addition to a systems course. These core classes are expected to be completed within four semesters (with at least an A- GPA), at which point the student will take the Written Qualifier and Oral Preliminary and be upgraded to a "Ph.D. Candidate". Upon successful completion of the Preliminary Examination, the student also qualifies to obtain a M.Sc. (called the "en route Master's degree"). After that, it's just research credits and electives as the students make a little bit of money, pad their CV with publications, and work towards the final milestone: the dissertation.

Since I'm picking up a heavy research load early on, I hope to actually do some teaching once I reach candidacy. There's a program called [Preparing the Professoriate](http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/preparing-future-leaders/teaching-programs/ptp/index.php), in which a student finds a "teaching mentor" with whom he or she actually prepares to teach an undergraduate course. If I don't balance my research commitments with teaching experience, I may have a hard time getting a good faculty position, so with the goal of becoming a Professor in mind, I think I've got a fairly well-thought-out road map prepared for when I fill out my official Plan of Graduate Work.

So, what am I waiting for?
