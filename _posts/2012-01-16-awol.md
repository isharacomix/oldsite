According to my blog's calendar, I've been hiding from everything for about 10 days now, and that's not healthy. I wanted to blog <i>more</i> this year - not <i>less</i>, and the first month is already halfway over! Since I can't think of anything more productive to write about, I'm going to talk about my first fun-filled week of classes for my <b>Second Semester in Graduate School<sup>TM</sup></b> and hold you off with this meme I made.

So, all in all, this semester has been a lot of fun! I'm taking another full load of three classes. The first is a course in compiler construction, and let me just say, I love me some compiler construction. It has all of the fun theory of Computer Science (grammar, automata, computability) with all of the fun programming of Computer Engineering (actually writing a program). It's been a long time since I actually did any real programming, so it'll be great to actually get back in the coding habit for a change. We actually get to write our own compiler for a programming language, which I've kind of done before, though my "compiler" was actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6502">6502</a> assembler. Writing a compiler is like solving a puzzle, and I'm really looking forward to the challenges that this project will bring with it.

Second class is Database Systems. Not a particularly exciting-sounding course name, but a cornerstone experience nonetheless. I'm taking it as a prerequisite for a course known as secure data management, but I've got a great professor who really knows the material well. I don't expect it to be an easy course, since databases aren't exactly my strongest point, but since I'm such a good student and don't goof off (much), I think this will still end up being a positive experience.

Last, but certainly not least, my favorite course of the semester looks like it's going to be my Data Mining course - once again, not a very glamorous-sounding title. Our professor is a wonderfully unorthodox lecturer, and it's certainly very refreshing to see someone who uses all of those "active learning" techniques that I've been hearing about in the teaching workshops I've been attending. I think I can say without a doubt that this is the first class I've taken that's completely turned the "dry college lecture" stereotype on its head, and I'm enjoying every moment of it.

After classes this semester, I'm planning on taking my Qualifying Examination and getting that out of the way sometime during the summer. After that, I just have to clear out two more semesters and then I'll be permitted to walk across the stage and claim my M.Sc. in Computer Science. This is going to be a busy six months, but I'm confident that I'll be able to pull through everything without losing my sanity.
