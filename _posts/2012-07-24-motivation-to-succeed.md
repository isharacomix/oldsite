title: Motivation to Succeed
---

When it comes to motivating yourself to get through the hard times that crop up during the long road to the Ph.D., lots of counselors suggest that you build a personal network of other students and academics that will support you and hold you accountable for your progress. I suppose that there is some amount of psychology that supports the notion that we are less inclined to slack off out of fear of letting down the people who expect us to succeed. However, the extent to which this approach works depends on the person, and for me, it doesn't work too very well.

In my case, what I do to build a sense of motivation is to assign personal meaning to various physical artifacts in my life - preferably those that I see every day, early in the day. I started this way back during Undergrad, where every morning at the bus stop, I would literally be right across the street from Red Hat, which was the primary motivator behind my choice to attend NC State. Each morning at about 7 AM, I would look across the street and see Red Hat's corporate HQ and remind myself why I was going to college. While this seems silly in retrospect, especially since I'm still <em>in</em> college, it was still a very helpful symbol that got me pumped and motivated to make the best out of my day. I've taken this trend with me to Grad School and I've identified three major artifacts that have  served the same purpose as Red Hat did years ago.

The first is my Research Journal. Remember a while back, <a href="http://isharacomix.org/2012/05/02/do-i-belong-in-technology">I mentioned that</a> I believed that every Ph.D. student should carry a marble-cover lab notebook? Well, I take that back. Instead, I really think that Ph.D. students should keep a nice, thick writer's journal instead. While the marble-cover lab notebooks are thin, durable, cheap, and certainly easier to carry around from day to day, they aren't the most attractive things in the world. One the other hand, a journal like this is so beautiful that it just inspires you to want to write something in it!

One thing I always imagine about my post-doctoral life is having a nice big bookshelf to hold all of my textbooks and magazines, and a journal like this would look so much better on a shelf years down the road than a boring old lab notebook. I still use a marble notebook for stuff like balancing my budget and checkbook, but I use this writer's journal for research, and it makes a great talking point during meetings with other students and faculty.

The second is actually a pair of two artifacts - my Undergraduate Class Ring and my ring from the Order of the Engineer ceremony. During Undergrad, there was no secret that I felt as though I didn't really belong in my University community, and while my grandparents paid for my class ring, I never actually started wearing it until after I was accepted to Grad School. It's a bit bulky and actually too big for me, but this only reinforces the fact that it's there. Because of the circumstances under which I started wearing it, when I see it I consider myself not just as a Grad Student, but as a part of my University.

The Order of the Engineer ring is a stainless steel ring that goes on the little finger of the writing hand, and it's actually kind of funny that I should even have it since technically Computer Scientists are not considered "engineers" under the Order's terms. However, as NC State recognizes us as Engineers, they still confer the ring and certificate when we graduate. I wear both of these rings every day to help keep my discipline in mind. Because these rings are representative of my Undergraduate career, I'm planning on getting a "class watch" when I get my Ph.D., properly engraving the back with <em>Barry Wayne Peddycord III, <strong>Ph.D.</strong></em>

Last, but not least, the absolute most important artifact that keeps me motivated to continue my work through thick and thin is this, right here: <em>my blog</em>. I set my blog as my browser's home page, so every time I get online, I get to see one of the many banners that my friends have drawn to remind me about my dreams to get through Grad School and become a Professor. When I'm doing well, I feel motivated to write about what I'm doing and to keep this blog alive. When I'm feeling down, I read about everything I've already done and it helps me get back up on my feet. Above anything else, this blog keeps me focused on The Plan&trade;, and I really don't think I could make it through Graduate School without it.
